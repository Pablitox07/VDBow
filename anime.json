However, they only like that person because he or she doesn't get in their way. No human would want to hang around a boring person.","1":"Manga that's born from people taking responsibility for their own work, banging their head in frustration, feeling cornered, and like they want to escape, and then using that extreme situation, mental ability, stamina, and panic to create... would never lose to some soul-less manga that's just made up of other people's ideas without any kind of resolve!","2":"Well, nothing in life is ever certain.","3":"The real world is scary. It\u2019s pain to deal with other people.","4":"Nobody thinks they're cuter than others unless they're conceited.","5":"It's you that I want. Do you not want me? Don't you want to be together? (to Rin)","6":"[after Naruto does his Shadow Clone Jutsu] Oh, there sure is a lot of garbage scattered around here. But, trash is just trash after all. It simply needs to be cleaned up.","7":"[after drawing the infinity symbol] I thought of it myself, it stands for... Mugen.","8":"Sometimes, the questions are complicated - and the answers are simple.","9":"If you're gonna kill me, then kill me. If you're gonna execute me, stop waiting. Until then, I live by my own rules!","10":"I'm prepared for anything! Up until now, I have been running away from every fight, afraid of losing. But running away is even worse than losing. Unless one continues to fight, without succumbing to the pain of defeat, it is impossible to achieve victory. That is what people I love taught me.","11":"You're too loud, Police Girl. I don't care if you're a vampire, you're still English. Have some manners.","12":"I was in the avatar state... But I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary...","13":"There's no one who can live their whole life being completely uncorrupted.","14":"No matter what, if you intend to interfere, I will eliminate you too.","15":"But... If you're the kind of person who can devote herself like that to someone, then I'll bet you anything there's someone out there who'll fall in love with you.","16":"There are three conditions to terrify someone: One, the monster can't speak. Two, the monster has to be unidentifiable. Three, it's meaningless if the monster can die.","17":"I want to hear it again, yet I don't want to hear it again. I want to see her, yet I don't want to see her. What do you call this kind of feeling again?","18":"Dreams, ambition, love, hope; in this world, could the glories of a youthful heart be.. forbidden?","19":"The second humans lose their comfort zone, the more simplistic their actions become.","20":"You can\u2019t cause a change without some courage and determination.","21":"Screw you, future me!","22":"Human hearts are complicated mysteries.","23":"You guys are free to have a fight anywhere you want to, but interfering with an innocent girl\u2019s meal is unforgivable. And, if it happens to be Lina Inverse\u2019s meal, you\u2019re lucky to be alive!","24":"If you begin to regret, you\u2019ll dull your future decisions and let others make your choices for you. All that\u2019s left for you then is to die. Nobody can foretell the outcome. Each decision you make holds meaning only by affecting your next decision.","25":"There's only one certainty in life. A strong man stands above and conquers all!","26":"If a person you love doesn't love you back, you're worthless. That's what I always told myself.","27":"For one that turns against God to come in person to receive judgement... Today is a good day!","28":"'Slacking off' sounds bad. However, enjoying more of your day with the time you saved by doing your job in a clever way is definitely not a bad thing. Times like that are what makes a human's life rich. If you exaggerate, it could be called laziness, surely. However, people only become mature when they are able to balance work with enjoyment. In short, if all you care about is your job, you're not fully mature.","29":"It is a tasteless life if you don't have something you regret.","30":"You\u2019re always in my mind and it makes me both happy and sad.\nI guess that\u2019s what it feels like to be in love.","31":"Playing a game by yourself is boring. You need a loser to crush so badly they can't recover.","32":"Know how strong you are... and do what you can do. If you misjudge your abilities on the battlefield... you'll get yourself killed.","33":"[To Starrk, about Lilynette] That child with you... Can you send her somewhere else? I can't really go all out with her there.","34":"Hey! Hold on, come back! I'll tell you what! I can lower those 1,000 provisions down to 800, just as long as you take part in the five hour story telling party.","35":"Hmm... *puts on a happy face* Delectable tea... *changes to serious face* or deadly poison?..","36":"There are all sorts of mysteries in this world, like snacks and candy and sweets falling from the sky!","37":"How far do you want me to suppress myself so that you'll be satisfied?","38":"The amount of money one owns ultimately decides the victor. This doesn't stop within the walls of a casino, or it's cash flow. It's a rule that forms the basis for a capitalist society!","39":"If all life is so important, then the most evil of all beings on this earth are without a doubt humans. If there weren't any people on earth, the environment and conditions that all living things live in would be drastically better. Even if there were no school to teach us the stuff we know, it would still be obvious to everyone, wouldn't it? Just think of all that's happened to the earth due to our desires and ego.","40":"I went with raven for a long bathroom break.","41":"I can't promise you that good things will come to your life, but I do know that no one but you have the power to give meaning to your life in this world.","42":"Bearing the sins of the children of earth, the moon begins to consume its light.","43":"This will just be a signal fire. We\u2019ll fill those heroes full of holes\u2026 and put them in their place. All for a brighter future.","44":"I don't think it's possible to save everyone. I just want to save as many as I can.","45":"If there's no one happy, is it really a victory?","46":"Sometimes, your future is already set, and there's nothing you can do about it. There are some things you just can't change, no matter how hard you work. Unfair, don't you think? It isn't an easy fact to accept, and I'm not telling you to, but that's just how life is. Unfair.","47":"Very well. Then krieg(German for \"war\") is what you shall have. We are a clenched fist, ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might. But, after enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness, for us, a simple, \"ordinary\" war will no longer be sufficient. We need a massive war! A war beyond any other that man's history has ever known! We are but a single battalion, the remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong. However, I believe that each of you old warriors is worth a thousand of their sickly soft children! We represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men!","48":"Love always happens without warning. At that time, the gears of fate will start spinning. Just like the hands of a clock, two people\u2019s hearts will separate and meet again. Eventually, they reunite.","49":"Without love, people could exist without knowing truth and falsehood. By knowing it, they cry and grief and get lost. I was the same back then.","50":"Schools are facilities where human society secludes the troublesome children by age criteria.","51":"Anything at all. Just this once I'll fulfil whatever your wish is. Whether is world conquest, or eternal life, or to defeat the saiyans that are coming to earth.","52":"What is truly good about a person can't be expressed in words, that it can not. What matters is the feeling of trust one gets after spending time with him.","53":"The coin is appreciated...but not as much as your smile.","54":"Everyone exists for a reason. As small as it can be. I'm sure you have a meaning too.","55":"Are you telling me to exploit an opening for the likes of you? Do not speak out of your league, boy.","56":"It's over when you give up.","57":"I wasn't always fighting for love and justice. I was fighting for my friends and loved ones.","58":"Look Goku, you can go out in public and have your hair sticking out in every direction if you want to, but not me!","59":"[To Yoruichi] It's alright! Kurosaki-san's potential is greater than mine!","60":"In the end, L is indeed the greatest detective on earth...","61":"They say that fools learn from their experiences, while the wise learn from history. I hope you're not a fool.","62":"When I'm with Iruka-sensei, I think if that's what having a father is like... *to Sasuke* When I'm with you, I think if that's what having a brother is like.","63":"Of course they are my family, isn't it obvious? And a wonderful family they were. It happened long ago when I was still in the flower of my youth. The cities began to grow wild, people lost hope for the future, they became lazy idol time wasters. And to my everlasting shame I was no exception. Thus I began to watch the 7 O'Clock news religiously every night!","64":"Why did you run away, Chitoge-chan? No... I don't want this... I won't be happy with you just giving up... To end up liking the same person. It's painful, for sure but Chitoge-chan, you like him enough to not be able to face him again after that, don't you? Regardless of who ends up with him, I want to be satisfied when it happens. I thought for sure that you think the same way. Is there a reason why that can't happen? Tell me Chitoge-chan...","65":"About Usui, I really don't know anything at all. It's mortifying... Yet I already don't want him to turn away.","66":"It\u2019s like a doll house. You hang out together and pretend to be friends, but when it doesn\u2019t suit them they abandon just you.","67":"That's right! Whatever the tragedy or the blunder is, only the things that actually happened are written in stone!","68":"Sharing your secret with someone means you involve them in your problems. It may make things easier for you, but your family could end up suffering for it too.","69":"No matter what, I\u2019ll be always be your friend. No matter how far you go, I\u2019ll be thinking about you everyday.","70":"Whether it's good or bad, it's so unfortunate to wake up during a dream.","71":"When you're sincere about doing something, you're stalked by the fear that there's no turning back.","72":"I yearn for true gender equality. I have no patience for one who talks about female privilege when it suits them, and then complains about someone \"not being a man\" when it's convenient.","73":"I don't think much of you for sending a girl your age to the place where a wierd man lives.","74":"The only one who can beat me, is me!","75":"All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, all the pain I felt, all the fighting I did with my life at stake... And my reward was her name and a single smile. Jeez... Talk about unequal compensation.","76":"There are some scars that never fade.","77":"You remind me so much of myself from the past. I also used to think that perseveration had some credits, that it was the best way to change the world... but with that alone you cannot accomplish anything. Without power, you're doomed to become dependent on others, that's the way the world works.","78":"Saying things like \"It would be troubling for her\" are just really convenient excuses for yourself. If you can forgive yourself like this, then you can just enjoy staying in your comfort zone, right?","79":"If you keep bad-mouthing someone, you might feel like as if you are on a higher position than that person. But in actual fact, its completely wrong to do that!","80":"What exactly is the end? The end. The end. The end. I've seen the end over and over. What is the end?","81":"Brilliant people shine more brightly than ordinary ones. They never regret or agonize over what they've done.","82":"I am not a hero. I can't make anyone happy with any result. I can only do what I deem right with me not hating my choice at a later point.","83":"I'm pretty confident about my reflexes. And pretty strong too. I'm a guy after all. When the time comes, I can protect you even at the cost of my life.","84":"I can do it I know I can do it. I\u2019m the guy who gets it done broken bones or not\u2026 No matter what\u2026 I can do it! I can fight!","85":"Nobody knows what will happen in the future. Something even better might happen tomorrow.","86":"I'm just a dude who's way ahead of his time you know? Does that mean I was born too early because time can't keep up with me?","87":"You were ready to kill another creature, yet you\u2019re scared of being killed yourself. Don\u2019t you think that is strange? When you point a gun at a living thing\u2026 this is what that act means.","88":"I took the life of the woman I was supposed to call mother in the process of being born... in order to become the world's strongest shinobi... I became the incarnation of sand...","89":"The tattoo is a symbol of my family, the Star Clan. They were a clan of assassins. Everybody knew they would do anything for money. After a while killing people wasn't enough, they were hungry for even more power so they began hunting human souls. But now it's just me, I'm the last member of the Star Clan. 13 years ago their souls were taken by Lord Death and the Meisters from the Academy. At the time I was still a baby, so they didn't take my soul. That's when the school took me in. That's it. The end.","90":"If you truly desire greatness, you must first know what makes you weak!","91":"Every sword belongs in its sheath. Go back to the sheath your master holds. Go back to Griffith.","92":"Gekokujou.","93":"It's nice not to be alone.","94":"At night the moon shines with daylight. Our dreams are an ocean\u2026 each wave is the dream of an individual. The tide is controlled by the pull of the moon\u2026 it illuminates our dreams. If you open the moon, you will discover the path to dreams. When one finds death, they are submerged in the ocean of dreams. At the end of life\u2019s path is a door that leads us to this ocean. Our dreams transcend the self to reach this sea\u2026 connecting us all within its lunar tide.","95":"*after seeing Grevil's unicorn hairstyle for the first time* I've never seen such a creative hairstyle!","96":"Having my fate decided for me from the time I was born goes against my view of beauty.","97":"On this planet you call females who have yet to become adults, girls. It makes sense then that since you'll eventually become withes, you should be called Magical Girls.","98":"Why did he smile? Why? Did he know he would be saved? No. In that instant, he must have understood that his life was going to end. Death. He accepted it. He was fully prepared for it and smiled.","99":"You won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t give it a try.","100":"What is right? What is wrong? In this mixed up world, deciding what is right and wrong is not easy. You can't just go by somebody else's rules. If you let yourself be controlled like that, you'll just become a puppet that can't make decisions on it's own. You have to live by your rules.","101":"No, things can change. But things don't have to change. Whatever is fine.","102":"When surviving today is so simple and matter-of-fact people tend to forget. They forget what it means to eat a pig. They say all life is equal, but how much life is consumed to keep them alive everyday?","103":"It\u2019s a slow but steady effort. I\u2019m going to beat fantasy with science. This is exhilarating.","104":"I am literally hemorrhaging generosity.","105":"Don't be frightened by the waves. If we read the flow of the waves and accept them, we can overcome it. There's no wave that can't be overcome!!","106":"In all things, I think having a dream requires having the resolve to struggle with reality.","107":"To me, Kawai-san is like a mirror. A mirror that reflects all the bad parts about you. A devil-like mirror that contaminates your heart.","108":"Hey Kaiba, maybe we should duel sometimes.","109":"Believe in your own power.","110":"Let me tell you how important it is to keep your mouth shut. Me, I've seen so many damn people going on and on about \"these will be the last words you ever hear\" and \"take these words with you to the afterlife\", and then that gives whoever they're fighting an opening to strike back. Crazy, isn't it? I see it all the time, in books, in plays, even in real life! I don't even know why, but somehow the more comfortable someone is with killing, the more they flap their mouth when it comes time to do the deed, yakking on and on and on. As you might have guessed, I myself happen to be such a person! And therefore, as such, in light of that revelation, I'll say that one is enough, and since that one is of course myself, I want you all to shut up. You're boring. Swallow those words and take them to the afterlife yourself, if you want them delivered there so damn much.","111":"Things would have been so much better back then... If we had heard each other's voices. I hate myself. I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else's feelings. Since then, my classmates have all looked down on me. I've lived for seventeen years, and I haven't lived one of them as a good person. The only time I heard your voice was when we got into that fight. And what pisses me off the most is the fact that I haven't changed at all since back then! But.,. But now, I think I can understand what you were saying... Nishimiya. Me and you... Can we be... friends? Shit!! I went way too far!! I was just gonna apologize and get out of here! Why the hell did I end up asking her to be friends?... Why did I even say that?! Jeez, that's so embarrassing! How can you even say that?","112":"It's true that there's a lot we don't know about this world. But that's why we must go forward and do what we can. One thing at a time.","113":"Love is like a firework from the past... it's more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off.","114":"It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.","115":"As far as I'm concerned, I think I'd rather know the truth. Even if learning the truth changed who I am.","116":"But your kindess doesn't come from being a Coordinator... it's because of who you are Mr. Yamato","117":"Who am I? One name you might have for me is the world, or you might call me the universe, or perhaps God, or perhaps the Truth. I am All, and I am One. So, of course, this also means that I am you. I am the truth of your despair, the inescapable price of your boastfulness. And now, I will bestow upon you the despair you deserve.","118":"*to Edward* There's something disturbing about having to be in your debt...","119":"The moment you back down is the moment you lose!","120":"The avatar state is a defense mechanism - designed to empower you with all the skills and knowledge of the past avatars. The glow is the combination of all your past lives. Focusing their energy to your body.","121":"Liars always say the same things. \"I'll believe in you. I'll protect you. I care about you.\" I'll never believe that again... No one will ever protect me. I won't even think about it. I'll fight alone, live alone, and die alone. I know... I've felt it on my skin and in my body... That it's better not to believe in anyone than believe and be betrayed!","122":"Never trust anyone too much, remember the devil was once an angel.","123":"Stop living in the past like an old man.","124":"Even the most ignorant, innocent child will eventually grow up as they learn what true pain is. It affects what they say, what they think\u2026 and they become real people.","125":"Items to invent: Bed, massage chair, humidifier, rubber band, Rube Goldberg Machine, religion... Religions are invented? I've learned something new.","126":"Man fears death and yet, at the same time, man is drawn to death. Death is endlessly consumed by men in cities and in literature. It is a singular event in one's life that none may reverse. That is what I desire.","127":"There are no convenient miracles, and there is logic that should be inviolable.","128":"I may be inept, but at least I don't forget to aim high!","129":"All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, all the pain I felt, all the fighting I did with my life at stake... And my reward was her name and a single smile. Jeez... Talk about unequal compensation.","130":"(to Kiritsugu) I shall not let you die easily. I shall use healing magic to regenerate your heart and lungs, while I rend every inch of your flesh. In pain and despair, you will die as you suffer. And while you die, you will curse them... You will curse the cowardice of those who hired you! You will curse the Einzbern's for disgracing the Holy Grail War!","131":"How come you wear glasses? I mean, you're really pretty but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fanbase. *To Miyuki*","132":"Why do people depend on each other? In the end you're on your own.","133":"I'm not fat, I'm pleasingly plump!","134":"If you don't want to be betrayed anymore, then start by doubting the person you want to doubt the least.","135":"Freedom is something you have to fight for, rather than something you're given. Being free means being prepared to carry that burden.","136":"No, not yet, now that you've made me this serious. Regret as much as you damn well want!!","137":"Idiot! Don't spit while you talk! Your virginity might be contagious!","138":"You're right. Whether I ever see that ygirl again or not, that doesn't change the fact that this promise is important to me. I'm gonna go on treasuring it.","139":"It's very difficult for me to step on an ant without crushing it.","140":"When I saw him struggling, with the odds stacked against him\u2026 it got me thinking\u2026 Who protects the heroes when they need protecting?","141":"It doesn't matter how much trash you pick up. You just have a pile of trash.","142":"You didn't raise a weapon. You raised a son.","143":"There's only one certainty in life. A strong man stands above and conquers all!","144":"Once the revenge is dealt, you are required to pay the compensation.","145":"I don't have any regrets. I'm glad I met you, Sousuke Sagara.","146":"How can you work so hard? There might be something really bad waiting for you ahead. How can you still make yourself move on despite that? The older we get...the number of annoying and troublesome things we have to face only increases- and wonderful things stop happening. In the days ahead of us... we have to bear each painful thing one at a time, conquering them...overcoming them...the power to do that just doesn't spring out of me. The power to move ahead.","147":"*talking about King Bumi* This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.","148":"If you have a wish, don't go back to the past and redo everything. If you want to change yourself, don't change the past, but change who you are now!","149":"The weakness that had accepted death now became the strength of wanting to live.","150":"Mere scores do not measure a person\u2019s worth.","151":"Only brute warriors find glory in destruction!","152":"We are all farsighted, we give importance to those things that are far from us, while neglecting the things that are close to us... only to realize their value later, when they are out-of-reach again.","153":"Everyone thinks at some point if what they are doing has any meaning or not. Will the day come when I get what's coming to me, or not? How much influence does my existence have on the world at all, or doesn't it?","154":"It doesn't matter what you do, if you live and die as you like. However, no matter what road you end up taking, remember to protect the people that are precious to you.","155":"You shouldn't mouth off when you don't know shit.","156":"Happiness depends on each person. If you think you're happy, then you must be happy.","157":"What could be more beautiful than doing work that puts your soul at risk, because that's what it means to be alive!","158":"There were two kinds of strength. One was the strength that came with having something to protect. The other was the strength of having nothing to lose.","159":"All for one, one for all! There are times when a man has no choice but to act!","160":"Smell ya later.","161":"I am not a hero. I can't make anyone happy with any result. I can only do what I deem right with me not hating my choice at a later point.","162":"Adults say you shouldn't do things half-heartedly. But in reality, you can get by with doing just that. Of course, it would be great to stand out. But how many people can live like that? It's really hard to be exceptional.","163":"Scrambled it trouble down.","164":"In exchange of being able to get something that normal people can't have... you must let go of what normal people have.","165":"I can do it I know I can do it. I\u2019m the guy who gets it done broken bones or not\u2026 No matter what\u2026 I can do it! I can fight!","166":"Being able to realize your own fault is a virtue.","167":"I can kill anything that exists - even if it's a god.","168":"I will hunt down Kikyou's killer and avenge her death","169":"Even if it's dangerous, even if it lasts until the ends of the earth... I need to walk my path.","170":"It's true, crying unexpectedly does make you feel better. When you're an adult you forget that.","171":"You can't be strong not because you can't throw away your weakness, but it's because you don't face your own weakness.","172":"If you live after giving up on the things you want to do and the world around you doesn't sparkle, it's the same thing as being dead. If you don't give up, even if it's short, it'll be a fantastic life!","173":"There isn't anything more painful than to have someone say that he doesn't believe you.","174":"The slight difference between those who always aim for the top and those who don\u2019t, it\u2019ll come to matter in a big way once you all emerge into society.","175":"If you can't see something through the end, then don't do anything.","176":"It's troublesome if the villain doesn't show their evil. Villains are necessary to make knights into heroes.","177":"There are things you can only share with someone by fighting. For instance, how serious you are.","178":"Maybe we can't help feeling scared alone! But we're all right here, together! We've got out friends close by!\nNow there's nothing to fear, because we are not alone!","179":"Any event is a personal episode, where only those involved comprehend what's happening.","180":"Game over. If that's the case. I just have to play again.","181":"Play to the last note, and leave no regrets.","182":"Any treasure you attain without anyone ever working for it is no treasure at all.","183":"No, order exists to protect the people. We must not aim our guns at the wrong people. What we should eliminate are our doubting hearts and minds.","184":"One ought to experience loneliness at least once or twice in life. No, you have to experience it. The idea of being chained to another person without reprieve is far more abnormal and disquieting. One has no choice but to learn about loneliness. I\u2019m sure some things can\u2019t be experienced without it.","185":"If you come across an event that's too good to be true, it's probably poison.","186":"I never... [chuckles]... laughed this hard in front of my parents.(to Tohru)","187":"Those who hurt her, put her in danger, those who caused her misfortune, I eliminate them. Even if the cause is me.","188":"[After getting hit by Yammy Llargo's Bala] You mean do I have a defence? Truth is, I\u2019ve never really had any plans against any attacks. I just knew I had to win so I did. That\u2019s my plan. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re higher ranked than the other Espadas' were, to me it\u2019s all the same. I\u2019ve gotta defeat you so I\u2019ll find a way to do it. Simple.","189":"I'll give you some wise words, Shining Sleepless General. All heroes die of overwork.","190":"Your own path is for you to find out on your own.","191":"What exactly would change if I wanted revenge, was consumed by hatred, or went insane with rage?","192":"If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow and began devouring humans, and from the same mouth you devoured humans, you cried out to me, \"I Love You!\" Would I still be able to say \"I Love You,\" the same way I do today?","193":"Are you afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance you avoid a betrayal of your trust, but you must endure the loneliness. Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone. Pain is something man must carry in his heart, and since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe that life is pain.","194":"I want you to be happy. I want you to laugh a lot. I don't know what exactly I'll be able to do for you, but I'll always be by your side.","195":"Even if you destroy the world, the world you wish for won't come.","196":"If I was the protagonist in this story, I'm sure someone would come save me. It would be like a miracle. But I have no one to save me. There is no god who would grant me a miracle. I'm a murderer, after all. But I've done nothing bad. All I did was feed myself. If I hadn't, I would have starved to death. Would it have been better that way? Am I evil because I didn't let myself starve to death? Give me an answer, Muroi-san! I didn't willingly become such a creature. But if I have a life, shouldn't I treasure it? Is that a sin? Muroi-san! This is what it means to be abandoned by God.","197":"Don\u2019t forget that kindness can hurt people too.","198":"To be able to forgive those who have wronged you... only the truly strong can do that.","199":"Let those who seek death find it.","200":"Your darkness and hopelessness are like vapor. They're nothing more than shadows that shall melt away and disappear under the moon's light","201":"People can live without friends. Friends are not oxygen or water, they're more like luxury goods.","202":"Justice is a weapon. It can be used to cause harm, but it cannot protect or save others.","203":"The more fun I have, the more it'll hurt when we part ways. I know that all too well.","204":"There\u2019s no reason to pretend to be cool. Let\u2019s show our lame sides. That\u2019s who we really are, after all.","205":"The future of humanity will be doomed. Having said that, I\u2019m not about to sit around while we all get slaughtered.","206":"Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!","207":"If all things are in fact preordained, then why... why is humanity able to think for itself?","208":"Having someone saying you're okay as you are and being needed by that person... It was nice to have someone like that.","209":"Can we really be proud of our own survival that's predicated on sacrificing our own? There lives aren't all we lose.","210":"It is a virtue to devote one's self to something, firmly believing in one's own ideals. But that does not mean it's alright to belittle the ideals or feelings of others. If you lead such a busy life and you don't realize how your parents feel, it's only self-satisfaction. It's alright to stop every now and again, if you want a moment's rest, if you want to feel what other people feel.","211":"No matter how painful, no matter how much solitary struggle awaits us, because we have joyous moments like this, we can face the challenges over and over again.","212":"I'm sorry for not saying this to you, Akihisa-kun. I know I shouldn't hide this from you, but I was wondering whether I should tell you this. Because if I told you that, you'll definitely tell me \"you should go\", or something like that. I understand you'll say that for my sake, but I don't wish to hear you say anything like a farewell to me, Akihisa-kun. Because-- I like you, Akihisa-kun!","213":"There's nothing known for certain. Adolescence is like that anyway. It's like a train ride with no destination and nobody. There's no destination and outside everything is flashing by so you can't see anything.","214":"Revenge that involves unrelated people isn\u2019t valid at all. All he\u2019s doing is hiding his vengeful hate with the title of God\u2019s representative and acting sublime.","215":"Even if you can't move anymore, or your back gets bent out of shape, it doesn't matter! What matters is what's inside! Not what someone looks like, dammit!","216":"[dying] Kuchiki, I dragged you into this...I'm sorry. You must've been scared. Thanks, Kuchiki. Thanks to you...I can leave my heart here.","217":"The president did say please.","218":"Is that so? Then I'll just use \"pathetic\" next time.","219":"What I want isn't money or pretty dresses, but a place that recognizes me as who I am. Fairy Tail is my other family, and it is a far more warming family than here!","220":"I want to know if it is a crime to live as you are, when you are different from others.","221":"There's always someone better. That's why I can't stop fighting.","222":"Loathe me, o fierce deity. Accept and awaken to your maelstrom of hate...god of calamity, Yato!","223":"Please, let that iron guard down for a minute. It's only hurting you. I know when you've hit rock bottom, people trying to cheer you up can be really annoying. \"What would you know?\" \"Just leave me alone.\" But what if someone you're pushing away is really worried about you? That'd be a shame.","224":"It is a simple story. There is nothing that brings me happiness. It does not matter, let it be believing in people or having people believe in me. What other people called happiness did not bring me any joy.","225":"Once you've been loved once and have loved once, you cannot forget it.","226":"Hey God, if you're there, my life has really sucked. So please, for once, let me have a sweet dream.","227":"You can't carry me AND dodge at the same time, Tetsuzaemon!","228":"Blood calls for blood, while hatred begets hatred, and the energy that comes forth begins to take root in this earth and engraves a crest of blood. They never learn, no matter how many times history is repeated. Humans are foolish, sorrowful creatures.","229":"If you don't see her, you won't fall in love. If you don't fall in love, you won't get hurt.","230":"There's something wrong with people who seek reality in fiction.","231":"We think the flower on the precipice is beautiful, because our fear makes our feet stop at its edge, instead of stepping forward into the sky, like that flower.","232":"Little fool, demons exist, all right. They\u2019re inside our hearts.","233":"Why don't you give it a try? You don't need to come up with a reason, you try things because you want to. Isn't that how you start doing things that you really like?","234":"Humans are easily tempted. When they are poised on the edge of hellish despair, and a spider-thin thread of salvation presents itself, they will invariably grasp it. No matter the human.","235":"Something this, something that--jeez you're annoying. (to Yuki)","236":"Unlike in manga and anime, in real life, no heroes can save you when you're down.","237":"The flowers bloom, then wither... The stars shine and one day become extinct. This earth, the sun, the galaxies and even the big universe,\nsomeday will be destroyed. Compared with that, the human life is only a blink, just a little time. In that short time - people are born, laugh, cry, fight, are injured, feel joy, sadness, hate someone, love someone. All in just a moment. And then, are embraced by the eternal sleep called death.","238":"Trunks, I never hugged you as a baby... let me hug you.","239":"He realized that he had lost sight of something important. No matter what turn he took he should have kept singing. Even if his songs couldn\u2019t save the world, he could still sing songs for her. Don\u2019t ever lose sight of what\u2019s important to you.","240":"Simple yet mysterious. Distant ancestors unlike any plant or animal we've ever seen. These groups of odd creatures have induced whispers of fear among man since ancient times.","241":"Oh! My little scythey boy!","242":"[clapping] A beautiful speech, I can see it now, you truly are a prince with the royal blood of a Saiyan.","243":"What is a glasses man?","244":"Don't care anything and do not do anything that's a waste of energy.","245":"What's past is past. I cannot redo it, nor go back to it. I have escaped from that scene and still continue to live. All I can do is look forward.","246":"In order to learn you may have to risk your life... no, even your soul.","247":"Aang, this is my friend Foo-Foo Cuddly Poofs, Foo-Foo Cuddly Poofs, Aang.","248":"Nanao-chan is last place!","249":"Choosing your calling based solely on your talents won't always guarantee you happiness.","250":"That rose whip of his must be ten feet long. Where does he stash it? All the ways I can think of sound kinda painful.","251":"A man who raises his hands on a woman is trash. If I have to become trash in order to survive... It'll be just like dying.","252":"As my fingers and toes re-grew like fingernails or hair over and over and over and over... and over again, every single time I got the feeling that I truly, truly truly was a monster.","253":"No matter what I attempt, even if it's the most simple of tasks, it always ends in failure. Unfortunately, I find that my life is one big regret after another. Yet, after all these years, I still don't know when to give up. Is it my fault to keep trying when the results are always the same? Is it impossible for me to make things right? Even if I'd try to give up, I don't think I could. It's not in my nature to submit in the face of disappointment. In the end, I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment. I really am an idiot.","254":"If you have time to think of a beautiful end, then live beautifully until the end.","255":"How can you not see the beauty of our evil?!","256":"*after Katsura asks him about what he is doing* Well, I suppose I'm doing something odd, like jogging or taking a walk or something like that.","257":"Don't judge me based on the same story and laugh.","258":"Now listen up, any power that surpasses reason, still comes from reason, right? Magic isn't some kind of miraculous power. It is a talent that only works when the flow of energy inside of us and the flow of energy in the natural world are in perfect synchronization. To perform magic one must have a strong mind and the ability to focus. It should take over your being and come pouring out of your soul! If all we do is worry about following rules, then our magic will never progress.","259":"[his parting words to Arrietty] My heart is stronger now, because you're in it.","260":"Is there a different sorry for simple and complicated situations? Whether it's a simple or complicated problem, if you think you've done something wrong, then in the end you'd say sorry either way.","261":"Especially Yuki... He was my first love after all... [Tohru stops walking]","262":"He's swinging his sword with the grace of a flyswatter. That's no way to survive.","263":"Anything can happen. No one ever thinks it will until it does. What will happen, happens. That's how the world is. The most important thing is to not let the tragedy defeat you. To believe that you can get through it.","264":"For a pregnant woman to give birth, she's gotta feel the pain of pulling a watermelon out of her nostril. For an Artist to create a masterpiece, he's gotta feel the pain of pulling entire galaxies out  of his ass.","265":"[talking about food] The last bite. It is the final one, and the most suitable one to enjoy the most. No matter what it costs, I will not give it up.","266":"First we\u2019re the milkmen, and now we\u2019re stinkin\u2019 farmers. We never did this in Orin Temple.","267":"Azula always lies, Azula always lies.","268":"If you are afraid to get hurt, you won't obtain what you really desire.","269":"I don't give a damn about the real world.","270":"Broken promises, regardless of how horrid transform into rage that stinks to the ocean floor. Through those bonds, we're drawn together countless times.","271":"How did you learn of the reality that you speak of? The entire world is governed by the reasoning of dirty-minded adults. We're able to obscure reality according to our obsessions. We're never actually shown what reality is. In this case, the reality that you speak of is a half-baked nonsense that has been altered. Trying to conform this bullshit reality into the one you want is like trying to join two pieces of a puzzle that do not fit.","272":"History books are rewritten with the changing of times. At any rate, classroom lectures are worlds apart from the battlefield.","273":"A person grows up when he's able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things that a person must learn on his own.","274":"I don't have the strength or wisdom to stand up against someone who is insusceptible to reason. You won't even give me time to make an effort. That's why I'm going to rely on numbers!","275":"The choices we make in life have unlimited possibilities.","276":"People... humans are the being who look for happiness. What the Britannian boy, Lelouch, wanted to have was nothing but a small happiness. It's nothing special. At least at the root of his motives, there were only humble wishes that were simply natural to any human. Who could ever disclaim such dreams and such vows? Who could ever have the right to do that? However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness. \nA remaining piece of hope, a faint sign of wishes will be born from despairs.","277":"Don't you think it's beautiful? That rosy red that spreads only where the body is wounded. Shall I paint you in that lovely red... little boy?","278":"The worst kind of pain is when you're smiling just to stop the tears from falling.","279":"Hero? No! We're pirates! I love heroes, but I don't wanna be one! Do you know what heroes are? Say there is a chunk of meat. Pirates will have a banquet and eat it, but heroes will share it with other people. I want all the meat!","280":"Exodia, OBLITERATE!!!","281":"The lifespan of a human is certainly way too short. That's why you've got to make the most of it and live your life to the fullest.","282":"She was stolen away before I even realized I liked her.","283":"Everyone makes mistakes, but then you recover. Look at all of the friends you have here who adore you. It would be difficult for anything to change that. If you keep that in mind, you should be able to get back on your feet any number of times.","284":"Unwilling to listen or see anything else, you lost yourself in your own world and became incapable of seeing the things around you.","285":"No matter where you are, people find a way to entertain themselves.","286":"There are things that take a long time to acquire. Friends. Love. Really, nothing has been a waste.","287":"(To Ichigo Kurosaki before getting shot point-blank by his Cero) I see. So you show no mercy. Just like a true Hollow. I care not. Defeated by you as I stand, my existence holds no further meaning. Do it.","288":"No matter how big the place is, we'll eventually reach the edge if we keep moving forward!","289":"There's a limit to the amount of pleasure a person can obtain. But pleasure brought out by intellect is infinite.","290":"First, we are born in the same galaxy. Born of the same species. Our lifetimes overlap. The meetings between humans are so unlikely as to be miraculous. To laugh, to cry, and to fall in love... Everyone is made up of a collection of 1% chances. Thus, I'm dazzled by the fact that there are so many miracles in this world.","291":"In this country, we don't call someone who can stop a scooter with her bare hands a girl. We call her a mountain gorilla.","292":"They\u2019ve been exposed to the outside world, up close and personal. They\u2019ve had that fear planted in them. And they\u2019ve endured it. Overcome it. Each has grown from that experience. And forgotten how to hesitate.","293":"I never said I was a witch did I? You just made that assumption all on your own. I'm really just a cat with a ridiculous amount of magical power.","294":"I want everyone to feel safe again soon...I want this to be a world where people can without fighting each other.","295":"A fair warning... we ninja of the Sand aren't as easygoing as those of the Leaf. But getting close to Kuroari so carelessly...isn't good!","296":"What people seek when the depths of despair and death are upon them, may be the silhouettes of the ones they love.","297":"YAAAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","298":"The world is very boring. Everyone tries to live like a normal person without a second thought.","299":"Nanika, will you forgive me for being a bad big brother?","300":"I work by myself. Only for Princess Tomoyo.","301":"They say \"there's always room for dessert\", but for me, it's more like \"there's always room if someone else is paying\".","302":"No world is more painful to live in than this one.","303":"Going against the flow... takes a lot of courage. I respect that. Maybe people who can do it are just stupid, but... Well... What I'm sure of is that people like that are rare. So you can't call them common. You can't call them normal, either. People like you... get called special.","304":"I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him,\"Do you know how many people are here right now\"? He said probably fifty thousand, since the stadium was full. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all.","305":"If I wouldn't have tripped, you wouldn't have stopped, now would you?","306":"People only have substance within the memories of other people. And that's why there were all kinds of mes. There weren't a lot of mes per se, I was just inside all sorts of people, that's all.","307":"Steal one, get one free!","308":"Don't go thinking you're my rival, you circus freak!","309":"They are your words! This is your heart! Our desire to help our friends belongs to us!","310":"What the hell can you hope to protect when your feelings are the only weapons you've got?","311":"I start wars, resolve them myself, then I buy up the war ravaged lands for a low prince and make a killing off redevelopment and reconstruction concessions!It is a brilliant scheme.","312":"When I realized, I was already on the roof of a building. ...I had come to hate everything. I was sick of sitting in my room holding my knees too. If nobody was going to notice or care if I died then... what's the point in living?","313":"My ears do more than just frame my face.","314":"If you take someone at puberty, a teen... introduce him or her to a member of the opposite sex around the same age and say, \"This is the person who was meant for you\"... and then go on to spend a lot of time together... why wouldn't you fall for them?","315":"Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you've gotten stronger, right?","316":"Ore-sama no bigi ni yoi na!","317":"It takes a mere second for treasure to turn to trash.","318":"I'm so happy I think I might die.","319":"God, if this world, this story, is moving ahead according to the system you created... then I first need to destroy that illusion!","320":"But I think... I want to live with all my memories. Even if they're bad memories. Even if they're memories that only hurt me... that I'd rather forget. If I keep them and keep trying, without running away, then someday I'll be strong enough that those memories can't defeat me. I believe that because I want to think that there's no such thing as a memory that's ok to forget.","321":"Everything in the world is actually connected. That means, even if we get separated, we'll never be alone.","322":"No matter how much despair awaits them, I wish that at the end of their story, the gentle light of hope will shine on them...","323":"Huh? What are you, retarded? I'm super thoughtful. That's why I stay in the corner and don't cause anyone trouble.","324":"Back then, if we could have have heard each other's voices, everything would have been so much better.","325":"A smiling, dependable, cool hero\u2026That\u2019s what I wanna be! That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it everything. For everyone!","326":"In a business like this, there are times when you need to change as the situation demands. I switch my personality depending on how I view things.","327":"Trusting someone not to hurt you... how idiotic is that?","328":"Eternity is instantaneous, and an instant is eternal.","329":"I just told you what I think, now say something DAMMIT!","330":"I may not have anywhere to go... but I can't just selfishly disappear either.","331":"After being driven out of the orphanage, I had nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, and, as one might expect, not a cent to my name. Yet, I lack the courage to commit theft. That is how I've arrived at my current predicament... However... if I wish to live, I have no choice but to steal and take from others!","332":"A smile is the best way to get oneself out of a tight spot, even if it is a fake one. Surprisingly enough, everyone takes it at face value.","333":"No matter how hard you try, you cannot exceed your true capabilities.","334":"I don't want other people to mention my \"self\". Besides, if I can be changed with a few words, then that wouldn't be my \"self\", would it?","335":"Enough. I've had enough. I'm dropping out.","336":"Please don't worry, Mister, I only came here to obliterate you \u2013 not rob you.","337":"Death is simply another stage of our life.","338":"The throne itself does not half a will of its own. Depending upon who sits in it, it can be the seat of justice or it can be the seat of inhuman cruelty. As long as it is a man and not a god, doing the governing, he can never be perfect. But should he neglect to make efforts to reach for perfection, a king will surely tumble down the slippery slope towards evil with no one around to stop him.","339":"I'm alright. All I did was lose a love. Even without George, this city is still overflowing with people. My days are busy. Nothing will change. But... why do the lights look like they're in black-and-white? Just because one person isn't here.","340":"On the internet, we only know each other's usernames. If we were talking face to face, I probably would never talk to them this way. They look at the \"Real Me\". They support me a lot... I wish there were more people like them.","341":"I would no longer fight against my feelings because I realized how useless and ineffective it was to fight them.","342":"Sometimes violence is the only way to get the message across.","343":"A pig that doesn't fly is just a pig.","344":"We'd rather die than abandon our comrade!!!","345":"If you act only on what you should do without heed for what you want to do, you're nothing more than a machine, a phenomenon.","346":"I'm not highly aware. I'm highly self-aware.","347":"What else would I be here for? To illegally enter the premises, of course.","348":"Listen carefully because I'm only gonna say this once, I love you.","349":"The ticket to the future, is always blank.","350":"Are you ready now to witness a power not seen for thousands of years?","351":"Once you've recognized your mistakes, it's easy enough to correct them.","352":"The world isn't as bad as you think.","353":"Doubt them. Question them, suspect them... and take a good, long look into their hearts. Humans are the kind of beings that can't put their pain into words, after all.","354":"A good book is always good, no matter how many times you\u2019ve already read it.","355":"I think running a restaurant would fit you better than being an assassin.","356":"I was trying to chop off your head from the eye up. A little scratch counts as a miss.","357":"People's thoughts don't always mirror how they feel. That's why they sometimes make decisions that seem nonsensical.","358":"Caring for things brings a lot of trouble.","359":"We have to fight in order to live. That's what will make us strong.","360":"Sure there are things you can't do, things that seem impossible, but that's what makes everyone unique!","361":"If you ever feel like dying to help the universe, just let me know. I'll be waiting.","362":"There are some people who don't want a solution. Some want things to stay the way they are. There's no way to make things convenient for everyone. So the only option is to find a compromise.","363":"The beating of a heart is the first source of music!","364":"Destiny is a mysterious thing. It lets people reach their intended destinations.","365":"Thinking about whether it's because of jealousy or just saying it out loud by accident, aren't they all part of love? Love isn't always sweet.","366":"Simple: girls are better at fixing pants than guys, and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.","367":"For me and Mello, L has been the only person we adore, and the only person who deserves our respect.","368":"If we are frightened, the people behind us will be, as well. You must be a shining star... that washes away fear, so that those behind you wil not be afraid!","369":"Don't judge people from the outside. Like any rose has thorns, the more the person appears nice on the outside, the more you should doubt the inside.","370":"The great flow that maintains the universe, call it the cycle of life, the course of nature each one of us is just a small part of that part. One in the all. Yet without all the individual ones, the all can't exist. This world flows by following grander laws that we can't even imagine. To recognize that flow, to work in it. To decompose, and recreate, that is alchemy.","371":"There are things that cannot be taken back. But the world will keep on spinning whether you laugh or you cry. High school life will eventually end too.","372":"Give advice and good guidance, then halt if such is of no avail. Do not disgrace yourself for it.","373":"It's not like people only look for help by saying \"please help me.\" In similiar vein, it's not like you're only in love with someone if you say \"I love you.\" Everyone has things they can't say on impulse.","374":"Hatred is born when people gather together.","375":"We have walked through the darkness of this world, that\u2019s why we are able to see even a sliver of light.","376":"What's the use of looking towards the past? If past data dictates reality... then our 33,1 winning percentage last year means we shouldn't even be playing the Mariners and their 66,7 winning percentage.","377":"What do you think a truly unusual life would be like? Something really unique. It'd be the kind of life where every single day, nothing new ever happened. Nothing changed. That kind of a life is truly unusual.","378":"The pain of getting hit, the frustration of loosing, the joy of winning, all of that. They've been driven into this body, fists, and this head. It becomes my strength in the next fight. All of my battles up to now, those memories, they are all of my power.","379":"Heroes and villains both thrive on violence, but we're still categorized. \"You're good.\" \"You're evil.\" That's how it is!! Symbol of peace? Hah!! In the end you're just a tool for violence, made to keep us down! And violence only breeds more violence.","380":"What is education? Isn't education meant to create a person that conforms to society? What kind of education must be administrated to create a human being that meets the society's demands? Education is an experiment.","381":"I'll never dream about things that I know won't come true.","382":"Live by your own rules. And have reality accept your own rules. If you are able to do that, the future is all yours.","383":"\"Trust\". The act is without a doubt a very noble one. But you know, what many people call \"trust\" is actually giving up on trying to understand others. And that has nothing to do with \"trust\", but is rather apathy.","384":"There\u2019s nothing crueler than letting a dream end midway.","385":"No human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings.","386":"I believe the difference between those up there and me is the question of whether you have given up or not.","387":"What keeps me alive in this world is neither bodily organs, nor muscles - it's my soul!","388":"As I had encountered kindness, I wanted to be kind myself. I wanted to be able to do something, just like others had done for me.","389":"He wouldn't notice if I got a crew cut, shaved my head bald, or even grew an afro!","390":"When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself, I want to go to a land that\u2019s far away.\nI want to go to a faraway island. I want to go to an island that has no people. I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness.\nThere are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island.\nOn that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the sea when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep.\nIn the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed.\nAdults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed.\nWhen I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away.","391":"People live to save themselves.","392":"Are you not your own master? You should walk the path you desire. No one else should be able to stop you.","393":"Don't just blame yourself. You're not tough enough to withstand everything. Split the load, to my shoulders, and to Ichigo's. Just stack it little by little. That's why we've become stronger. Believe in him, Rukia.","394":"It wasn't the pain that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My tears aren't from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength to live.","395":"If at some point in life, you made a mistake or keep failing over and over again, and you can't help but think it's useless and you're a good for nothing; Remember, you're only taking a detour. And I'm sure further along your path will come a day where you think, \"It was a good life experience\". That's why it'll be fine.","396":"Yeah, I know. It's not good to be reading Jump at my age.","397":"Manga endings might always end the same. However, if it comes to life. Neither you or I are mere readers. We are writers.

Destroy it from the outside, or correct it from the inside.","399":"I can't exactly fight a war with a big smile on my face.","400":"[referring to a group of thugs] I disposed of some dangerous beasts. Mere animals that just happened to resemble humans.","401":"Those who do not want to advance spiritually are fools.","402":"You brake the law and I'll punish you, there is no room for discussion.","403":"Life's never been easy! What you abandon, and what you take. Even I know that repeating that choice is what it means to be alive! But... If that means I have to keep losing everything over and over... I'll risk my life to try and take it all! I won't give up! Ever!","404":"It takes more courage to speak the truth than it does to wield a sword.","405":"A detective who corners a culprit with their reasoning and drives them to suicide in front of himself - is no different than a murderer.","406":"What does someone who\u00b4s lost their standing want the most? That's simple. They want someone to find them, where they're standing.","407":"It must make you sick to know an underling like me is going to kill you.","408":"Sometimes you can't see what's right in front of you.","409":"It's not the face that makes someone a monster, it's the choices they make with their lives.","410":"We will not just fade away, thought there's no way to know how long it may last. We WILL leave our mark on this world!","411":"What kind of mad scientist worries about not getting enough vegetables?","412":"Sincerity with respect to yourself! No matter what your objective... no matter who you are... if you are going to do something or not do something, that is a promise to yourself. And the one who keeps the promise, or breaks the promise, is you. No one else can be burdened with holding you to a promise that's made to yourself.","413":"Do you know how many civilizations are crowded together in the universe and how much energy is used up in one second? Eventually, you humans, will leave this planet as well, and join us.

I won\u2019t let Sakuna out.","418":"I'm warning you. You so much as bruise what you hold in your hand and I will show you pain. The hue of your soul will cease to matter, because you will not be judged when you die, you will no longer to exist.","419":"The human mind is uncertain things. Within mind, even contradictory thoughts may coexist.","420":"Being strong isn't just about having power or move, it about one's spirit","421":"I do not fear this new challenge, rather like a true warrior I will rise to meet it.","422":"There is always a chance of success, and if there isn't any, I'll just have to make one.","423":"What isn't remembered never happened.","424":"Defiance toward parents is an establishment of one's self; it's a sign of independence.","425":"If the results come true, it's as if there's only one future. If it fails, we can think that other futures exist... I want to believe that in our future there are many possibilities waiting.","426":"I wonder why people make promises they won't be able to keep.","427":"One human only has the power to do so much. That's why I'm going to protect...even if it's just a handful of them...the ones most important to me.","428":"In the end no one's going to protect you but yourself.","429":"So, yeah. Strong animals don\u2019t gather in herds or anything like that. Do they not know the expression \u201ca lone wolf\u201d? Cats are cute and wolves are cool. In other words, loners are cute and cool.","430":"I confessed you know!? Many, many times! Even though I knew the answer from my mouth... with my voice! I confessed you know!? Have you ever looked at Raku straight in the eyes!? Is that all you've got for Raku!? At least for the last time, you need to be a little more truthful to yourself!! If you really liked him, then you can't just pretend like nothing ever happened!!","431":"You're not God, nor are you a sister. But it's because I feel that you're much closer to me than God, I'm much more afraid of being hated by you.","432":"Always trying to make myself seem strong... So I locked my own heart in a suit of armor.","433":"One guy's killed for killing another and then he's killed for killing him. How is that kind of twisted thinking ever gonna bring us peace?","434":"See, \"empty\" just means you have plenty of room to take in all kinds of new things. Fun things, precious things, painful things, things you've never seen before!","435":"Pum, Pumkins, Smashing Pumkins!","436":"How do you know that the person you were one second ago, is the same person that you are right now?","437":"I'll be waiting for you to get your asses back here!","438":"Neither God nor the Devil can give aid to those without the will to fight\u2026","439":"If I try to deny my past, I'm denying the person I've become. I don't want to do that.","440":"[To Orihime] Your heart? You humans say that word so lightly. As if it were something one can hold in the palm of one's hand. But my eye sees everything -- Nothing can escape it. What it doesn't see doesn't exist. That's how I've always fought. That's how I've always lived.","441":"There's no such thing as no such thing.","442":"I could kill you, but I wont become like you, who uses power for his own egoism.","443":"Naruto... Just so you know, there will be a war to protect the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. In other words - you. For the sake of the ninja world and as the Kazekage, I will guard you with my life. If as a member of Akatsuki, Sasuke Uchiha stands in the way of the ninja coalition... I will show him no mercy.","444":"You sure can talk the talk, but you're not quite ready to walk the walk. Time's up, it's my turn.","445":"Love for the dead is pointless. We fight to keep them alive, that is all.","446":"Embrace your dreams...and whatever happens, protect your honor...AS SOLDIER!","447":"The world has too many heroes. It needs a monster.","448":"It doesn\u2019t matter how much we see each other, but how much we think of each other.","449":"I think... memories never disappear. Just like the paint I use. Even if I mix it with a new color. The old one still remains. Forever.","450":"Humans can't live without memories, you know. Still, they can't live on memories alone. You have to awaken from your dreams eventually. Because dreams you don't awaken from eventually become sadness.","451":"I may be the only swords-lady among the pillars who can\u2019t cut a demon\u2019s head off. But anyone who creates poison that can kill demons can be quite amazing.","452":"Once the kiln is opened and the pottery inspected, all that are crooked or bear cracks are fated to be smashed. If all that awaited us was the fate of smashed pottery, then we decided we would rather run away in the hopes of finding a different future.","453":"Seems appropriate for Nicol. A weapon fit for a coward.","454":"Humans are creatures that dream. Different from others, they want to be special. They want to be adored by others, just like the heroes in comics and games, achieving great things with unique powers. Of course, no one ever believes deep down it will happen. Everyone knows there's no magic in this world.","455":"We reset, and return to our separate lives. You can't reset your life, but you can reset your relationships.","456":"I am who I am and there is nothing wrong with that. The days continue like they always have, bringing neither excessive desire nor despair, nothing's changed. Yet I'm overwhelmed by this sense of fulfillment. I'm over here, you're over there. If I'm your savior, then you're mine.","457":"Loving someone means entrusting all of yourself to that person.","458":"When I told him my feelings, he understood. When I said I wasn't lying, he believed me.","459":"True kindness isn't something we're born with. It's something we had to work on... (to Tohru)","460":"Perhaps in this universe, there exists a solitary, absolute truth. Perhaps it clarifies every question. But that\u2019s beyond the reach of these short hands.","461":"To put things simply, if your past makes your present... Then your present can and will make your future. When you think about it that way... You absolutely have the potential to be anything you want to be, don't you agree?","462":"I'm only attracted to girls in games!! Reality is just a shitty game.","463":"I probably won't be able to look forward to summer for a long time. My chest will hurt. My tears will be overflowing. But this warmth in my hands and these summer memories will live on in my heart.","464":"I don\u2019t know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that\u2026 No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it\u2019s right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.","465":"Protect the one thing you want to protect until the very end.","466":"Really, what's with that? Such a power doesn't even appear in Academy City's databank. If I am a 1-in-328,571 prodigy, then aren't you, the only one in Academy City, a 1-in-2,300,000 disaster?","467":"What do you think it means to be the strongest man in the world? The strongest man in the world has power, skill, wisdom, heart, and luck.","468":"If you try to acquire something, you'll lose something else along the way. That's the truth of this world. No matter how sad it is.","469":"They are more like \u201cpeople who don\u2019t follow rules\u2026\u201d There are different kinds of people in different worlds! \u2026 Between you two and them, what is the difference? It isn\u2019t unusual\u2026 to put it to an extreme\u2026 A hero during a war would be just another murderer in peaceful times.","470":"Living your life sympathizing with others in your everyday life is more powerful, than living your life based on a religious belief or some story.","471":"To take responsibility is to take the pain onto yourself. It means to bear more pain than what others felt because of your mistake.","472":"I love the type of woman who can kick my ***.","473":"Accident or amnesia, you can't rewind your life and start again. If you struggle, you'll just hurt yourself, and the people around you.","474":"When I fall it will be silent and tragic.","475":"In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.","476":"As far as relationships with other people go, they don't just end because one person decides that it's over.","477":"Ugly? I'll have you know they call me The Rose of Martial Arts around here!","478":"If I were to survive, but couldn't protect what was important to me, then I might as well be dead.","479":"Whether we die or not, isn't really that big a deal.","480":"I am Horo the Wise Wolf, and I am a very proud wolf.","481":"A guy with only a cat for a friend won't look attractive by playing cool.","482":"Listen up, I don't care what you punks do around the universe. But with this, my sword\u2026 anywhere it can reach, is part of my country! Asses who blunder in and violate my things\u2026 whether it be a Shogun, whether it be space pirates, whether it be a meteorite - I'll destroy them!!","483":"I must protect my fledging Utopia.","484":"Even if I'm not around, nothing will change, you say? It's not as if I'm living my life to prove something silly like that! We live our lives to see how the world changes around us, don't you think?","485":"People have to save themselves. One person saving another is impossible.","486":"It doesn't matter if we're wrong...because every time we go wrong, we'll continue to look for the right answer.","487":"*To Tamaki* It's easy to feel sorry for him, but the hardships that he endured as a child, molded him into the person he is today. He'll be fine, the Host Club is his refuge, which means when all is said and done... he still has us.","488":"What are you so hesitant about? It\u2019s your dream, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s right in front of you and you\u2019re wavering? You gotta be reckless, and take whatever you can!","489":"I now see that the circumstances of birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.","490":"If a person continues killing, their heart changes into that of a demon without them even noticing.","491":"The past is gone, you can not change it! But the future is based on the decision you make!","492":"Is there... somebody precious to you?","493":"There are people who can't act unless they're faced with a problem. Unless they find their reason. All I was left with was the sinking suspicion that I'd gone horribly wrong.","494":"What a strange creature is man, who would cage himself so willingly.","495":"I knew it. The Earth Forces' new mobile weapons. Father, I knew you'd betray us all!","496":"I was, I am, and I remain a soldier, sworn to devote my heart and soul to the restoration of humankind! There is no greater glory than than dying for that belief!","497":"No matter how strong the pain is, it's our duty to move forward. You're wrong for running away from reality.","498":"Why did I fall in love with music in the first place?","499":"People cannot win against their loneliness.","500":"There are bad ways to win and good ways to lose. What's interesting and troubling, is that it's not always clear which is which. A flipped coin doesn't always land heads or tails. Sometimes it may never land at all.","501":"Courage must know fear and make fear its own! Fear upsets breathing! Conquer fear and your breath will never fail you! Hamon breathing comes from courage! A good human is a brave human! Courage is a marvel of humanity!","502":"It's not a sense of justice. Figuring out difficult cases is my hobby. If you measured good and evil deeds by current laws, I would be responsible for many crimes. The same way you all like to solve mysteries and riddles, or clear video games more quickly. For me too, it's simply prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on cases that pique my interest. It's not justice at all. And if it means being able to clear a case, I don't play fair, I'm a dishonest, cheating human being who hates losing.","503":"There are two types of dreams. Dreams from when you're awake and dreams from when you sleep. And both of those can become reality, if you strongly wish for it.","504":"He told me...that which is incomplete seeks completion... yet...that which is incomplete is no better than that which is complete. Do you understand?","505":"For the time being, all an idiot like me can do is to keep moving forward...","506":"As long as no one got hurt, it's all good. Who cares who saved who?","507":"Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking.","508":"Death is a privilege of the living. A destiny without reason, continually roving on, evermore. How fleeting a thing it is. One cannot live and forget about death. The despair that is me, forgotten by death, can at least embrace my yearning at twilight, and sleep.","509":"If you think reality is just living comfortably and following your own whims, can you seriously dare to call yourself a soldier?","510":"I may not be able to beat you, even if we play a hundred more games. But if I have a chance of beating you the 101st time, I'll challenge you again and again.","511":"Merits, demerits, risks, returns; if they were these things then I understood. I could understand.\n\nDesire and self-protection, hatred from jealousy. I could analyze the mentality of the actions that were grounded on these abundant, repulsive emotions. That's because I had plenty of those ugly feelings inside of me. That's why it was simple to imagine. if they were similar things, then there was still room to understand it. I could explain using logic.\n\nHowever, if there wasn't, then it was difficult.\n\nWithout the concept of profit and loss, it was hard to imagine the feelings of people who went beyond people who went beyond logic and theory. I had too little to go on and above all else. I had committed too many mistakes up until now.\n\nGood will, friendship, or even love; they were all things I had been mistaken with. I was sure that I was mistaken with them even now as I thought about them.","512":"Rarely does one have the chance to exchange blows with heroes from another age. And with the chance to fight as many as six, I can't allow one of them to fall right now. Look at Saber and Lancer. Both are valiant warriors I would love to duel with. It'd be a pity to let either die.","513":"I'm surrounded by idiots.","514":"You can't perform the same trick twice with one audience. If performed only once, the magic leaves a strong impression. It will then blossom into a beautiful miracle in their hearts. But, when used twice, rather than the audience enjoying the magic, they focus on unraveling the trick. As such, the chance of it being unveiled is high.","515":"Different people have different perspective. So, I won\u2019t deny the fact that some people are annoyed with the way I am. In exchange for those negative feelings, I just want to be the person that I am in love with the most.","516":"Being hurt on the outside is better than being hurt on the inside.","517":"A dog's happiness is measured by how useful he is to his master.","518":"A friend would not just follow another's dream... a friend would find his own reason to live.","519":"Only I could do it! I was well aware that killing people is crime in itself! Yet at that point it was the only way to make things right! I thought to myself that someday people will come to realize this as much, and regard it as an act of justice! I had no choice but to act as Kira\u2026 it was the destiny given to me. I was chosen to renew this rotten world, to bring about true peace \u2013 a utopia.","520":"I think that in the end, I just care a lot about myself. I was the only one that I loved and respected. That's why I was scared to know what the others thought about me. I was afraid to get hurt, so I ran away and locked myself into my shell.","521":"When the world is filled with red lights signaling danger, the world is safer than usual. But when it's filled with green lights signaling safety, it creates a place more dangerous than anywhere.","522":"New eras don't come about because of swords, they're created by the people who wield them.","523":"You know what, I wish I could give everyone a happy ending. But life isn't some romantic anime and I can't fix what's wrong in life stumbling around being oblivious and nice all the time.","524":"Be on the Side that saves people, if both sides are the same, become a good man.","525":"[to Luppi] Hyourinmaru is the strongest of all ice-type Zanpakutoes. Your weapon may have eight arms, but mine is all the water in the atmosphere! Sennen Hyourou!! [causes several pillars of ice to form, before using them to crush Luppi] Sorry. Eight wasn't enough.","526":"Everyone has a sword within their hearts; the purer the heart, the sharper the sword.","527":"It's the sky...that allows the clouds to move about freely.","528":"It would be cruelest to keep your hopes up when I already know the answer.","529":"I'm the sniper king, sogeking.","530":"I'm an abomination! I'm filthy and dirty! And unbalanced! Why is there only one set of stripes?! I'm garbage! Asymmetrical garbage! I deserve to die!","531":"There are only so many lives I can value. And I decided who those people were six years ago. So you shouldn\u2019t try to ask for my pity. Because right now, I don\u2019t have time to spare or room in my heart.","532":"Urameshi, I'm gonna mess your face up so bad that kittens won't even look at you.","533":"If you ask what life is to me, I'd answer endless days of homework and pain. Why you ask? The amount of homework, it's too much.","534":"If it's not enough to believe in justice, then I will become justice. I will seek out all evil in this world and wipe them out like the clouds in the sky. I swear I will...For justice.","535":"If everyone were perfect, there would be no need to look out for others. Sympathy or love is needed because people are imperfect. A perfect human cannot love anyone.","536":"When you aim to reach high places, you may find yourself on narrow footing and feel disheartened. And then your confidence will falter, and you will find it ever harder to believe in yourself. If you ever feel that you can't believe in yourself, please believe in your friends.","537":"When pressured, people tend to choose the decision that is best fitted to the situation, but they usually realize later on, that it was a mistake.","538":"You were chosen as a single fragment with which I will fill up my boredom.","539":"Aren't we all monsters inside?","540":"I... don't know why I'm alive. I have no reason to live. I have no interest in others. Living without concern for others... That's the way to live. Working a job that earns me just enough to eat... A life like that was enough...","541":"Kindness is weakness. Your weakness will delay the trigger by a moment. This world doesn't treat kindness kindly.","542":"There are things people can't accept, even if they do understand them.","543":"I killed many people to act on my ideal. I killed so many that I stopped caring about innocent people and I saved a thousand times as many as I killed.","544":"Even if people refuse to accept you, it doesn't change the fact that I accept you and don't want you to leave.","545":"I was feeling down, but you distracted me by subjecting me to your selfish whims. There are times when selfishness can save a person.","546":"Whether you win or lose... You can always come out ahead by learning from the experience.","547":"While it takes time to recover from the loss of a loved one, having an opportunity to take your mind off things helps too.","548":"No matter who I was with, I could never forget you.","549":"And there you go. You heard her, Iri. Our Heroic Spirit thinks a battlefield to be something better than Hell. What a joke. It's Hell itself. There is no hope on a battlefield. There is nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a crime we call victory, paid for by the pain of the defeated. But humanity has never recognized this truth. And the reason is that, in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded the people with their legends, and kept them from seeing the evil of bloodshed. True human nature has not advanced a step beyond the Stone Age.","550":"The double grief of a lost bliss is to recall its happy hour in pain.","551":"I'm a pirate hunter.","552":"I just wanna enjoy myself. Seriously. Do some leisurely patrolling, put in a few appearances, say Aw shucks, no trouble today, and get a good night\u2019s sleep! That\u2019s my ideal life! I wanna make this world one where heroes have time to kill.","553":"Stop Whining! All I did was cut off your stupid legs! Summon your demons! Transform yourself! Regenerate your legs! Stand up! Pick up your gun and attack me! Do something! The night is still so young, and the real fun is yet to start! Hurry, hurry, hurry, HURRY!!!","554":"SLEEPING is the only TALENT I have.","555":"Thinking of you wherever you are. We pray for our sorrows to end, and hope that our hearts will blend. Now I will step forward to realize this wish. And who knows... starting a new journey may not be so hard, or maybe it has already begun. There are many worlds, but they share the same sky... one sky, one destiny.","556":"You need to accept the fact that you're not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face.","557":"Over the course of several hundred years, I've seen many ages end, conflict between people, hatred, wicked hearts. I always have hope that the new age will purify all of that. How many times has it happened? People repeat themselves. They commit the same mistakes, over and over.... They haven't survived, not in true sense. The precious race called people has become extinct.","558":"Embrace your dreams. If you want to be a hero, you need to have dreams.","559":"I guess it's only natural for inferior beings to ride on the coattails of their superior counterparts. If they wish to keep their lives, they have no choice but to obediently comply. It's a never ending chain... as the ones who are burdened with that trust, in order to escape that burden, seek to find someone even greater than themselves. These greater beings then seek others even greater than themselves to shelter them. This is how Gods are born. But make no mistake. They all still abide to me. Because from this point onward, you will witness first hand, the power of the God they foolishly placed their faith in. I will become that God they have no choice but to believe in.","560":"Cute, cute Nanao-chaaaan. Lovely, lovely Nanao -- AHHHHHHH!!!!","561":"We might not be a family by blood, but, we should treat all the teammates we\u2019re going to make in the future as family!","562":"You shouldn't judge people by how they look.","563":"Before my eyes, it blocks my path. A high, high wall. What sort of scene is on the other side? What will I be able to see there? \u201cThe view from the top\u201d. A scenery I will never be able to see on my own. But if I\u2019m not alone, then... I might be able to see it.","564":"Not fighting frantically for your life is all right, too. The important thing is\u2026 to decide on your own what you should do.","565":"You see everyone wants everything, that's the way the world is. But I just might actually get it.","566":"Oops. They found us.","567":"Those bound by superficial rules who do not use their pawns to the utmost are fools.","568":"So don't be afraid to open your hearts to others. It's pointless to keep testing people. All you're doing is hurting yourselves.","569":"If you have money, life is the same no matter where you go. But if you don't have money, your life can adapt to where you are.","570":"The scariest thing about killing people is getting used to it! When you kill someone and realize you won't be punished... That's when people forget all about punishment!","571":"Nothing's perfect, the world's not perfect, but it's there for us, trying the best it can. That's what makes it so damn beautiful.","572":"Boredom - there are people that blast their own brain away just to escape from this beast.","573":"Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.","574":"You're wrong. It's not the world that's messed up; it's those of us in it. Yes, some ghouls walk a path that leaves sorrow in their wake, but just like humans, we can choose a different path altogether. We have a lot to learn, both your kind and mine. We need to stop fighting, and start talking. Because when it comes to the state of the world, you can't point your finger at ghouls or humans. We're all to blame.","575":"Don't bother coming to the darkness that you don't need to see... I don't want to show you the darkness that doesn't belong to you... Don't let yourself be hurt so much anymore... Rather, let me be your strength.","576":"If I'm around you, I don't think I'll ever be bored.","577":"I won't die no matter what. That's what I believe, so stay silent and believe in me. I am a guy who will never die.","578":"Can I shoot them now?","579":"It's game time!","580":"Humans... Do humans have a purpose when they are born? I have been wondering recently. Because they are born, do they have an important duty? The meaning of being born... For humans to find that answer... It is the one freedom God gave them.","581":"I thought that would be the only way I could become the world's strongest man. But you know... It didn't work. Your heart isn't something you can get rid of. If you're trying to get rid of your heart, your heart is making you do it. You can never abandon everything to get stronger. The one thing you can never stop is falling in love with someone!","582":"Only victors are allowed to live. This world is merciless like that.","583":"When cats are near death, they leave their owner's side, right? I'm sure that's exactly how I feel. I want to disappear while they can think, \"What a noisy, stupid girl she was, I wonder if she's doing okay.\"","584":"Being prepared to die doesn't mean shit. The real hard part, is being prepared to live.","585":"I know that I have no strengths to offer. It irritates me how weak I am. But let me protect them!","586":"You're disgustingly hideous! What the hell kind of thing are you? I've never seen anything more messed up in my life! Do you know nothing about symmetry? Whoever made you should be dug up from his grave, shot and reburied! You make me violently ill.","587":"I will protect Hinamori.","588":"I'm okay with anything as long as it doesn't harm me.","589":"I don't even know the real names of the two... no, three that I killed back then. I just close my eyes, put my hands over my ears and tried to forget it all.","590":"Wrongly placed jealousy is ugly when it goes too far.","591":"I consider everything that happened to be precious moments of my life. The pain. The suffering. The fun\u2026 And I am here right now, because everyone was there for me. I couldn't have accomplished anything by standing still, without anybody's help. I treasure every moment I have spent here. Unlucky? I feel pretty lucky. This is my resolve.","592":"Please... even if I die surrounded by snow that never melts... please let her be happy.","593":"Talent is a key factor, of course, but without some luck on your side you're likely to fail.","594":"Boys, am I not always telling you to get in touch with your feelings, your inner gangster? Okay, actually I don't care about your feelings, never did, never will.","595":"Those who regretted their own actions. I would never trample over them. Because demons were once human, too. Just like me, they were human, too.","596":"Yuji, You\u2019re a strong kid, so help people.","597":"It's not that I'm on the side of humans. I just really don't like you guys.","598":"I just don't understand the reason why humans continue living on all the while as our individual egos hurt each other...","599":"If I'm bad at doubting others, I'd rather believe in them! If I get tricked, I'll think about what to do when it happens! Things are simpler that way!","600":"If it's a fight between a man and man, choose the path you believe is right. Only a fool would stand indecisive after being frightened at the thought of being soiled by the mud.","601":"The longer you're with someone, the tougher it is to part ways.","602":"I'm prepared for it all. Even if my chest hurts, even if I'm ripped apart, I won't let myself taste any regret.","603":"Black Star, I can't come down, there's water. Carry me.","604":"Every girl is born a princess, some of them just forget is all.","605":"People can never truly understand each other! That's why we communicate and try to understand. We can only understand ourselves through being with others!","606":"We probably are.  I can't explain it very well, but it seems that lately it doesn't matter, human or spirit.  If your hearts touch, it's the same thing.  When you're all alone, you get lonely, and the first step is always scary.","607":"Even if I die, you keep living okay? Live to see the end of this world, and to see why it was born. Live to see why a weak girl like me ended up here. And the reason you and I met.","608":"Everyone will always question your ideals. That's simply reality.","609":"Howl, Zabimaru.","610":"[a giant satellite bomb is headed towards the city] If that thing hits, do you think we'll have school tomorrow?","611":"How I envy the feeble and frail... If I were inept, I could simply blend in, not stand out, and get lost in the crowd. I yearned to be just another sheep... And if that was asking too much I'd settle for... walking among the lions.","612":"[clenches Fist] No matter how intelligent or how strong they are still nothing but vampire trash.","613":"If you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be... a tragedy.","614":"Once you miss the opportunity to say something, the words become increasingly toxic. The best thing to do is to just say everything.","615":"Do evil, get caught, then claim demons were brainwashing you. A common way that human politicians evade responsibility.","616":"Canaan. You're a victim whose past was taken away by war. And she's a defeated person who lost her past in a power struggle. Soldiers who are born within destruction, take hatred as their weapon. Even though you and her became soldiers for the same reason, you both live differently. Listen Canaan, you cannot counter hatred with hatred... ever.","617":"A samurai doesn't need a reason to do what's right.

You\u2019ll get better very soon.","622":"War does not determine who is right - only who is left.","623":"Once drowned in the depths of darkness, you lose sight of light. When that light has dispersed there is no return. My light has died out long ago and so there's nothing back for me to go back, or look forward to I shall continue to indulge myself in this darkness until it completely consumes me, then I will be nothing but an empty course left on this cold & cruel world to rot.","624":"Magic is not meant to be used to kill people... but without power we can't even protect the ones we love...","625":"An earnest failure has meaning.","626":"Depending on your request, whether I will laugh or get angry - that will decide your lifespan, boy.","627":"Symmetry is key everything must be esthetically pleasing. That's why I use the two of you as twin pistols in order to preserve symmetry. When I hold you both I'm completely balanced on the right and left. It isn't perfect because your human forms are so different from each other though. Your hair styles and height for example. Even your boobs are different sizes!","628":"Windscar!","629":"Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.","630":"[after Hisagi thanks him] Aren't you clever?

To my surprise, she was the same kind of person as me, and she had the same kind of eyes, at first sight, I realized I wasn't a solitary existence in this world, I was so happy. That's right, until I met her, I was all alone in this world, I had not a soul with whom to share the scenery before my eyes, and not a soul with whom to share the music in my ears. But...I heard the voices all over the world, I could hear the whole world crying out, \"save me\". It's true, thus I could see the optimal path of the world. But it saddened me, because the moment I saw her - I knew we were never meant to be, yes, she refused to side with me. She rejected me - the only person who could see the same scenery.","633":"Listen Ochaco, when I think about the people I love it makes me wanna become them. This desire to take all their blood for myself gushes up till I just can\u2019t stand it. I get all emotional just thinking about it. That\u2019s how I am, but other people aren\u2019t like that. It\u2019s so hard for me to live like this.","634":"Hidden in truths lie lies, hidden in lies hides the truth.","635":"Hold your tongue, the dead don't speak.","636":"Friends are connected by heart!

No... Maybe you won't even be able to see it.","639":"You shouldn't judge something without trying it first. Having a variety of experiences is what makes life worth living.","640":"I will stay by your side, my friend. Know that I am here, and that I am sorry. I am sorry that... I failed you.

I underestimated my enemy.","641":"If you\u2019re too lucky, people will get jealous of you.","642":"Don't believe in the you that believes in me and don't believe in the me that believes in you. Believe in the you that believes in yourself.","643":"People have emotions. A troublesome attribute that's not only invisible, but also changes easily. If it's friendship or love, then that's fine. But if by some trigger it changes to malice and vengeance, then that could bring forth thoughts of murder.","644":"Well, I don't see what's so funny. I'm honest, I speak my mind, and I don't hold back. It's sneaky people like Kaoru who are the troublemakers.","645":"We don't have time to waste asking for the things we don\u2019t have, we can only look for the best way to fight with the things we do have.","646":"I don't think it's all that bad to be surrounded by people who don't care much about authority or social status.

I have to thank the Servamp of Melancholy! In every era, wars have created progress!","648":"People remember their high school days as the high point of their lives. People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in high school; however, I doubt that every high school student would want to remember their school life that way. For example, if neither studying, nor sports, nor socializing are of interest to someone, what then? What if there are students who prefer to keep a low profile? Though I guess that would be a pretty lonely way to live.","649":"Time and titles do not matter in the bonds between people.","650":"Though possessing two eyes, most creatures can see but a single thing at a time.","651":"While it may be that ignorance is a sin, it's impossible to know everything.","652":"When the guarantee of safety is dangled right in front of their eyes, humans will turn their eye from probability.","653":"If it's my fate to be shot down by you, I thought this place would be appropriate... However, it doesn't look like there's any chance of that happening. After all, how could the \"child\" ever hope to defeat the \"parent\"?","654":"We're all the same. No one really remembers the day he was born. We all have to trust another's word on the matter. It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

YOU CAN GO TO HELL! HAHAHAHAHA! UGH! (gets kicked by Kyo in the face)","656":"Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops.

And then comes this line... \"The truth is I've hated you from the moment I met you!\"","667":"With death staring you in the face, you truly understand what it means to be alive.","668":"Even if you can't walk or stand and even if you can't have kids, I'll still marry you, I'll always stay by your side.","669":"Whether your words...are lies created to deceive me... or the truth that I have sought all my life... It makes no difference. You will rot.","670":"Girls could never understand the passionate bonds that we men share. Male friendship is a bond that runs thicker than blood!","671":"No one fears death. They fear the life that leads up to death. If one could die without suffering, no one would fear death, right? Being alive is, itself, an exception. The natural state of things is death. And life is, itself, a kind of sickness. When the illness is cured, your life vanishes.","672":"So stupid! Stupid, Stupid! You're so stupid! You want to live your life scared of being ratted out?! Screw that! I'd rather let everyone know everything!! (to Yuki, Tohru, Kyo, and Momiji while destroying a classroom)","673":"If we had spent more time together, maybe I would have seen another side of him. I wish I knew him more. I wish I knew more about what kind of person he was. I wanted more time. If we had more time, we would've gone through things together. Maybe we would've gotten annoyed at each other and fight. Maybe we would've disliked each other, or liked each other more.","674":"[talking to Kiba, who is being held in a cage] Man, you really screwed up. I mean, I've seen one of us get hurt before, but never this badly. And you're caught, too.","675":"We\u2019re always serious. We\u2019re seriously joking around.","676":"\"Isn't it okay?

This is an important provision do you understand?","686":"People aren't so simple that they can accept anything and everything.","687":"Flattery will get you everywhere.","688":"Anyway, here's my point. Trivial setbacks like yours and mine are nothing but common occurrences in everyday life! Getting hung up over pointless crap like that shows that you're a joke! A complete and utter joke!","689":"In this world, when you face forward, that's the future. When you look back, it's a memory. And if you clip a part of it out, that becomes a story.","690":"Everybody has to display a certain loyalty to their paycheck. I was the same way. It isn\u2019t just a piece of paper, but a chain that binds people.","691":"It's still too early for you to win against me.","692":"People who know how painful it can be to be alive, are fascinating.","693":"The first requirement of being a hero isn't being right. It's being strong. That's why the hero always wins.","694":"If you're ever lost in the darkness, follow the compass in your heart.","695":"No matter how much we think we want - it's never enough. I just want one thing to go right for me. I just need something to give me the energy so I can keep going.","696":"Love means money these days.","697":"No fair, sky. I'm the one who feels like crying.","698":"I hate perfection. To be perfect is to be unable to improve any further.","699":"Good\u2026 death is chasing me. Ones who kill are also chased by death, always living alongside death\u2026 Jobs that risk one\u2019s soul are truly beautiful! How rewarding\u2026 my battlefield!","700":"There are many unusual things in this world. Everyday events occur that cannot be explained. Bizarre phenomena that often go unnoticed because people close their eyes to what they don't understand. But the truth of the matter is, there are many unusual things in this world. And people... People are the most mysterious of them all.","701":"I'm home. What, are you greeting me in an apron? You look pretty good in it.","702":"I'm an arms dealer anyway. There's no point in fearing what I sell.","703":"Even if you think I\u2019m a nuisance, no matter where you go, I\u2019ll find you. I\u2019ll always be listening for your voice. When the rain falls, when the wind blows, when the flowers scatter, when shadow looms. In every sign, I\u2019ll search for your voice.","704":"It is far more difficult to capture an enemy than to kill them. Capturing a soldier involves three times the effort and three times the danger. If you wish to save the life of an enemy soldier, remember that you'll lose three of your own in the process.","705":"You can't direct armies from your bedsheets.","706":"Sketching a scene as you see it gives you a sense of being there, that's totally different from painting a copy of a photograph.","707":"Stop rushing me. I want to take my time falling in love with you.","708":"I'll enjoy shaving you to death.","709":"I have not changed at all. There were two of me to begin with. It was merely a swap between us. I have no intent on hiding this. Whether or not you believe it is up to you, Tetsuya. However, if you want to call it a \"change\", then that was because it was necessary. The team did not change because I had changed. I changed because the team had changed.","710":"Thanks for the real vote of confidence. You two should be cheerleaders, you'd look cute in skirts!","711":"God gave us eyes at the front of our heads so we can look forward to the future.","712":"When a human is victorious is when they're most vulnerable.","713":"Ashes to ashes.

Hmm...I wonder if that makes me special or something.","715":"The heart moves where the heart wills.","716":"When a person is hard to reach, someone has to extend their hand to that person to get to them, because of that dream, because they dream that freedom really exists, the roses will look up at the sky when they bloom.","717":"I never wanted anybody to hate me. I don't belong to any groups, and I have to fight and struggle to build myself up. In the end, all I want is just to not be hated by everyone.","718":"All this time, I've lived in hope of telling you how sorry I am, I've fought armies, just to have this chance, but now, there's nothing I can say.. That's good enough.","719":"I called his name again and again. And I learned that each time, nothing called back. I learned that no matter how much you want something, how many times you scream to it, sometimes it's out of reach. I decided to stop calling out for someone who would never call back.","720":"Do whatever you think is right. That's the way of the Fairy Tail mages.","721":"It doesn't matter if you can make 100 friends. Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 is to them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it's a friend that you care about.","722":"When someone does something nice for you\u2026 shut up and accept it!","723":"Human beings don't feel pain with their bodies. The brain is the thing that transmits the pain to the body.","724":"I have no intention of risking my own life to save someone I had no intention of saving in the first place.","725":"This world is merciless, and it\u2019s also very beautiful.","726":"The more painful the memories one recollects, the better the laughter.","727":"Of course, every soldier is prepared to die. But these people aren't just pawns on a chessboard. They all have names, families and feelings in their hearts too. They are all humans who live and bleed. You have the responsibility to ensure their death will not be in vain. No matter what may come, remember this in your naive heart, and be ready to die to fulfill that duty.","728":"I don't think it's completely such a bad thing to cling to one single person, but you have any number of people all around you. People are always connected to one another. You see? Just reach out your hand, and there's someone right here. It's when people realize how lonely it is being on their own, that they start to become kind.","729":"It may be better to go and regret it rather than staying here and regretting it.

If they are, then you should never think of changing yourself. Otherwise, you will lose everything that is precious to you.","733":"Moping around with sadness and sorrow... what will come of it? Even dead people can do that. However, I'll live and stand on my own two legs. If we are going to die one day, wouldn't it be better to have no regrets?","734":"If you are weak, don't bare your fangs.","735":"Aah... I said I'd \"answer you\" ... Not that I'd \"give you a straight answer\".","736":"There are things you can't see unless you change your standing.","737":"I believe that some truths should never be known.","738":"It's not a crime!

I'll take hold of it. I refuse to give up while I'm still human I can do that much. But every person must decide on his own whether to grab it.","744":"Even now, she continues to burn away her life in order to bring about a beginning rather than an end... She just looks forward while dreaming of the outside world. But you know what I think? Isn't it a bad thing to just look forward? Sometimes looking to the side, or looking back... There just might be something important there. You may have lost something. There may be the smile of a loved one. Isn't it impotant to try looking around once in a while? That's how it was for me. I could only ever face forward, could only move my legs with reckless abandon. I never had any idea what sort of footprints I might be leaving behind me. No, in truth, I couldn't even look ahead. The fact that I've never seen anything was scary... so I went on a trip to find what I truly desired.","745":"A world where everyone is equal and receives the same treatment. No such place exists. If there was a world of equality, where talent and aptitude didn\u2019t matter, we would all be equally snubbed there.","746":"Now you know what fear does to you. In the face of death you thought.","747":"The opposite of love isn't hate, it\u2019s apathy.","748":"Say, how about we put an end to all of this? The two of us could become Witches and destroy everything! Everything in this world that has ever made us hate, everything that has ever made us cry, will turn to ashes until nothing is left, like it was all just a bad dream! We'd have no worries! Isn't that nice?","749":"If a person could so ideally control their feelings... how carefree would life be?","750":"This is just my opinion, but when it comes to teaching somebody discipline... I believe pain is the most effective way.","751":"There is strength in words... Sometimes, they become words of power. I thought that if I said I'm fine, then I really would be fine. But it's no use... It doesn't work.","752":"Anything edible is acceptable. Extravagance is our enemy.","753":"Battle was a thing which was won by living and which was lost by dying.","754":"Asking me for compassion is mistaken.

Bang bang banging on people's heads like that. Are you hoping to become a tambourine player? If you don't like Shin-chan, then how about Sen-chan from secret operation?","765":"*talking about Gintoki* It's the same as always. He doesn't pursue those who leave, and ignores those who come.","766":"I humbly call the Gods of Harvest. Follow my wishes, leave none unfulfilled!","767":"You listen carefully, Sena.

Once he gets his eye on you, he'll drain all the life out of you until there's nothing left but skin and bones!","768":"People can face tomorrow because they can see reality and accept it. By denying reality, you cloud up the present, and tomorrow will never come. No, you can cloud it up, but your tomorrow will be that much crueler.","769":"You think you're the only ones who matter. You think you can put off death. But that peace made you foolish and thoughtless. If you kill someone, someone else will kill you... this hatred binds us together.","770":"It was just a rebound! Don't make a big deal over one or two arms!","771":"That is why I will keep running for now. If I aim for the distance, there should come a day when I would be able to reach out to what I have been aiming for.","772":"You can't sit around envying other peoples worlds. You have to go out and change your own.","773":"If you've forgotten death... then you've forgotten what it truly means to be alive.","774":"I have no desire to kill you. In fact, you're not worth killing. Killing you, would only tarnish my blade.","775":"The heart may be weak and sometimes it may even give in, but I've learned that deep down, there's a light that never goes out!","776":"That's like what an evil organization in some anime would do.","777":"Evil is when you use the weak for your own gain and crush them under your foot.","778":"If you truly want to continue escaping from everyday life, you've no other choice but to keep evolving.

Dreams fade away after you wake up.","784":"To you, life was just something you acted out and ended, all according to someone else's script. That's why you were always quoting Shakespeare. However, Aika, I say that you were wrong! You did what you shouldn't have, and didn't do as you should have. Because you relied on someone else's script, you were wrong. I won't live my life by another person's script. Not by Hamlet or The Tempest. I don't know how many years in the future it will be... but I'll write and act my own ending.","785":"Misfortune\u2026 that is my symbol. Unluckiness\u2026 that is my identity.

Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.","792":"It sucks, but you can't reach a happy ending just by doing what's right all the time. Actually, the more people get stubborn and insist they're in the right, the further away happiness gets.","793":"I\u2019ll use my flames for a better purpose!","794":"For as long as human history goes on, the past will continue to accumulate.

Yes, tomorrow would be different. Hm. Tomorrow. As much as I wanted to believe, it only went from bad to worse. A vicious cycle... I didn't want other kids to grow up like me, so I started my own orphanage. It was gratifying work, I was actually doing something for the good of others. It was my place of peace and happiness... yet sometimes, I still think to myself \"there's no place worse than this planet. It's horrible here.\"","796":"I've never been victimized for anything.

I think that's our responsibility as strong soldiers.","800":"It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it's someone you don't care about, you won't notice you've hurt them. What's important is your awareness of it. It's because you care about them, that you feel like you've hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you'll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that's not something to be sad about, I think it's probably something to be proud of.","801":"I can stand not eating or sleeping, but I absolutely would not be able to live without my computer.","802":"Thumbtacks in my shoes would stick into my feet whenever I tried to walk.

While looking up... and getting looked down on... we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing. That's why we can go our own way now. Still... Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan.

Just doing one thing would make you seem hateful.\nThat\u2019s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful.","993":"A person can only murder another once. The act of murder is giving up the humanity that is within oneself. What is left is just emptiness. You can not lose humanity if it is already lost. The act of murder turns into the act of slaughter. They are two different things.","994":"All humans are loved by another and build up emotions with them. That's nature's providence. There's no way around it. And it's pointless to question it. A bug with wings has no idea why, but it can't help but want to fly. When two people can't help but seek one another out, I think, in essence, it's exactly the same scenario.","995":"Whether it's disappointing or not depends on the person. Things like uneasiness or indecision are in everyone's lives. What's important is to appreciate and grow from every kind of result. If you can grow from them, you can understand that all events are for the purpose of growing and you can appreciate them.","996":"After you've gobbled him down you'd be left alone to regret it while covered in blood and guts. That's the hunger of a ghoul. That's our destiny.","997":"Knocking others down to gain an advantage is a fruitless endeavor. It means they've given up on winning any other way.","998":"Life is something that can never be lived twice. Even this pointless act will eventually end. And while thinking that one day, I'll surely regret its end...","999":"I consider your class of demon very worthy, worthy to fight, and worthy to die.","1000":"Sovereignty means absolutely nothing in front of me.","1001":"My speciality is lacerating flesh. Anyone interested in experiencing my skill firsthand, step right up.","1002":"Humans have always spent a lot of time on love. I\u2019m not too interested in karuta, but I\u2019m willing to work hard for love.","1003":"Ah... what a beautiful sound. It doesn't get any better than that. I can feel it deep in my bones, like a part of me I never noticed before. That sound is an extension of my being. And this land - this land that's governed by death - I will paint it red with this shard of destruction.","1004":"You need to learn how to make mistakes before you grow up. When you are young, you can recover quickly when hurt. When you get older it's harder to make mistakes. The more responsibilities, the less mistakes you are allowed to make.","1005":"I'm ho-ome! Yuki-kun, Tohru-kun, I'm home! Oh, and let's not forget stupid-clumsy-Kyo-kun-who-lost-yet-another-fight!","1006":"I don't care if it is fortunate or unfortunate that Light picked up the Death Note.

It is generally bad luck for a person to be followed by a God of Death.","1007":"You'll never know what's right or wrong until everything is over.","1008":"GOOD MOOOORNING ICHIGOOOOOO!!!!","1009":"I'm not a genuine idiot like you! I'm an idiot who accepts the fact that he's an idiot!","1010":"Recklessness is the way of the young and tolerance is the beauty of adulthood.","1011":"You cannot restrain me with logic.","1012":"When you someday find a way of life that you can truly be proud of, you'll be forced into your own battle whether you like it or not.","1013":"The thing called \"justice\" changes its shape... Depending on where you stand.","1014":"On that day twelve thousand years ago, on the summit of clouds reaching the stratosphere, remember that evening when we watched the prominence rise from the sunspot together\u2026\nEntrusting our bodies to the Earth\u2019s love, we listened carefully to the memories of the sea etched in every droplet of the falling rain that morning. When we looked up at the ocean\u2019s singers who had gathered at the swaying great temple, the voices of prayer\u2026\nThat day, under the Tree of Life, we entrusted the beginning of the world to those reverberations\u2026 Remember that brilliance.","1015":"I can\u2019t even imagine a world without Light.","1016":"When I was a child, whenever it snowed, I would play and make snowballs. When you start rolling a snowball, someone will always appear out of nowhere and help you make it bigger and in the end, everyone goes home satisfied. It was then that I suddenly thought \u201cThis is what I want to grow up to be like\u201d.","1017":"Are you going to keep staring at me because it's ticking me off. If you got something to say, say it.","1018":"What If I didn't fold the toilet paper? Something like that could ruin my life forever. I can't be defeated by toilet paper, if I turn my back on this I shouldn't be allowed to live anymore.","1019":"The right to use my friends as a weapon, that is the sinful crown I shall adorn.","1020":"I never had anything this good before. I guess everything tastes good when I'm with you.","1021":"The only one who should decide which path to follow is yourself.","1022":"Even with the energy you took from me, my power is still far greater than your own.","1023":"No one knows what the future holds. That\u2019s why its potential is infinite.","1024":"Even if you lose all memory in your head, the ones engraved in your heart and the ones that exist in your soul will never disappear, no matter what happens.","1025":"It's all useless.","1026":"Ice can even stop the time of life itself. So, you'll never be able to catch up, for eternity. You'll always be stuck there, staring at the fairy's tail.","1027":"They call certain methods of fighting good and others evil, acting as if there were some nobility to the battlefield. Such illusions, perpetrated by heroes throughout history, have led countless young men to their bloody deaths, all for the sake of this valor and glory.","1028":"We do not give a starving man a fish. We teach him how to fish and make him independent.","1029":"Spilled water will never return to its container.","1030":"In the end, mustering the courage to confess is up to the people \n\nconcerned.","1031":"Ah, I'm sorry, I guess this is farewell. Let Tohru find happiness. Please by many people let her be loved. If you become perplexed or make errors, in the end have the kind of life that you can have pride in living. The kind where you can say, \"I persevered\". Repeating delightful things and sad things. And in that way keep getting older. I persevered. (Part of Kyoko's last words that were never said)","1032":"Men select women based on emotion. Even if there's a reason, it's only secondary. However, women select men based on reason. Either by something like his class ranking or his standing in society.","1033":"To me... This world is like a dark night that swallows everything.","1034":"Looking back on the past is a dangerous thing. It's nothing more than an attachment.","1035":"I am not going to take sides, I am neutral. I am talking about standpoints here, that is all. Miss Class Representative (Hanekawa Tsubasa) has her point of view and her parents have their own. There is no way for an outsider to know which of them is right. Actually, there is not a right one in the first place. It is just about who is easier to agree with.","1036":"A Gun is Good. Unlike A sword or a knife, it doesn't leave the feeling of a person dying in your hands.","1037":"The weak can never break out of their own mold. They cry piteously within their cells, while they try to kick down anyone who strives to break free.","1038":"Go ahead! I'll just turn you into the police for assaulting a minor! (To Kyo)","1039":"[to Iroh, while he's bathing] Enough. we need to leave now! Get out of the water.","1040":"You\u2019re not a strong person, so you can really understand how weak people feel. I mean\u2026 Most humans are weak, including me\u2026 But if I got an order from someone who saw things like I do, no matter how tough it was, I\u2019d do my damnedest to carry it out.","1041":"[to Katara] If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.","1042":"You men. All of you, you're horrible. Cheating on every woman. But you, you I actually decided to trust. I put my faith in you. I can't believe this. I wish that all of you would just die!","1043":"Love is never without trials and tribulations--precisely because of that, there's bitterness. What do you think? The feelings from liking someone... cannot be satisfied by your own efforts alone. It's not the same as simple anger or sadness. One-sidedly declaring your feelings... this doesn't bring satisfaction. Only when the other person feels the same way... Only when two hearts love each other is fulfillment achieved.","1044":"*referring to Winry* I didn't know she could be so cute.","1045":"There are some people who are rich and stay in beautiful places but are still unhappy.

If you're just going to end up hurt in the end, you're better off not forming any bonds at all.","1053":"We\u2019re searching for a reason of existence. With our own strength, because maybe the truth is that there\u2019s no reason for life from the very beginning. Everyone hopes and tries so hard to find a reason of existence. The reason of birth, of staying with someone, of existence, believing we have to find them all with our own hands. Like finding a place for ourselves in dreams, in jobs, in people. The reasons we conclude may be indefinite and fragile. We may lose it too, but even so, we want a reason. As long as I\u2019m alive, I want it too. If possible, I want to find a reason of existence within a person, within someone.","1054":"Too much curiosity kills both dreams and hopes...","1055":"Hey, Shu, have you ever read a picture book called \"The Kind King\"? The king was really kind, he gave everyone money and land, until finally... the country was gone. The people were all mad at the king. But I really loved him. I think he was my first love. You're like that king, Shu. The way you lose because of your kindness. You know what? I think you're going to be a great king.","1056":"\"Every experience is a tool to clear your path.\" It was none other than those students who taught me that.","1057":"Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe the traffic.","1058":"You - Idiot! Go ahead and cry! When I'm with you, you don't have to hold back. *Usagi runs into his arms, sobbing*","1059":"You can use whatever technique you like, but now that I said I will kill you... your death tonight has been assured.","1060":"Ash to ashes, dust to dust, trash to trash can and useless people to uselessness box.","1061":"Most of the winning results in war is caused by pursuit. Do you know why? Leaving aside modern times, it seems during the era of bayonet warfare, the worst losses always, arise from the moments when the losing side is being pursued.","1062":"Time gives us happiness, but it can also take everything away from us.","1063":"Enjoy your life today. Yesterday is gone, and the tomorrow might never come.","1064":"You opened a path\u2026 to reach further heights\u2026 and you abandoned it\u2026 Very weak.","1065":"Adoration never leads to a balanced relationship.","1066":"A lot of the time, you\u2019re going into a situation you know nothing about. So what you need is to be quick to act\u2026 and make tough decisions in worst-case scenarios.","1067":"To cry because there is something you want to do and to cry because you can't find it. Which is more painful? The only thing I can say is even with all the words I have now, I can't stop her tears.","1068":"Even if I did win, it was boring. How can it be interesting unless you win in an interesting way?","1069":"In every world, once you die, you're gone.","1070":"I won't give up, I will fight til the bitter end, cause there's no way I will back down after what you did to my friends. They are what made me the person I am today, that's why I'll keep fighting... For my friends!","1071":"...and even if you were to hate yourself as much as you want, you have no choice but to live with yourself forever. Other people just go by. Eventually what's left to you at the end is only yourself. Even if you can't seem to like yourself, shouldn't you at least compromise?","1072":"In society, those who don't have many abilities, tend to complain more.","1073":"My mother told me something long ago. She said \u201cThe world belongs to you just as much as you belong to the world\u201d. For you were born and that gives you the right to exist.","1074":"Cherry blossoms in Spring. Stars cover the sky on Summer. Full moon shines on Autumn and in Winter, the snow covers the ground. All these things make sake taste good. If it tastes bad, it's because there is something wrong in you.","1075":"Obviously you are underestimating Kurama. Do you know why I chose him to be my partner? To avoid fighting him myself. Watch, he's more cut-throat then I am when it comes to battle, and unbelievably precise.","1076":"Theories are nothing more than words. Accept what you've seen.","1077":"A wedding is a man's grave.","1078":"...Without love, it cannot be seen? ...Hah. That's backwards... Because of love, you end up seeing things that don't even exist.","1079":"Even if I can\u2019t see you\u2026 Even if we are separated far apart from each other\u2026 I\u2019ll always be watching after you. I\u2019ll definitely watch over you forever\u2026","1080":"Life is all about challenges, There's no point in living if there's no one strong to play with, It's better if I can't win.","1081":"You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.","1082":"Stupid ocean!!! Ya want me to kill you? Huh??","1083":"There's a limit to the strength of people who are isolated. If we do the best we can we should be fine. We don't grab a hold of the entire future. Let's just think about grabbing tomorrow. I think that's plenty for us, don't you?","1084":"Goodbyes are only one side of the coin. You can't say goodbye until you've said hello.","1085":"Whether you like me or not, the fact that you're precious to me won't change, no matter what.","1086":"I haven't said anything about letting them commit murder...yet.","1087":"I think you've got me all wrong. My motives aren't so sophisticated as \"revenge\" or \"honor\" or any of that... The reason I killed all of those men... was because I could. It's that simple.","1088":"You know how they have parameters in games? Like, you're good at magic, but your combat skills blow, or you're a great fighter, but you lack in the brains department.","1089":"Fear isn't evil, it only allows us to learn our own weaknesses. When we learn our weakness, people can grow stronger and kinder.","1090":"Everytime Otani says or does something, I end up going to heaven, or hell.","1091":"Does it hurt? Relish the taste, because it is going to be the last sensation you feel in this life.","1092":"My mom always says, strangers are just friends you haven't met yet.","1093":"Moving on doesn't mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what's happened and continue living.","1094":"Tell me, what do you think is the ultimate fear? I really thought I'd already reached the darkest of the dark, but then, ahead of me, I beheld a darkness even greater still.","1095":"Time will try to constantly try to catch up with you. And with a roar, it will overcome you. Do not look ahead. Hope only lies within the unforeseeable current that will close in from behind.","1096":"You're wrong... You're wrong about that as well, Oz! We're just two people who met through someone called 'Elliot'. You're quite mistaken thinking we were friends through him. Because I don't know a thing about you!","1097":"The smile of you, who flew through this window and died, I won't ever forget, not even tomorrow.","1098":"Keep flying higher so that others are inspired to fly with you.","1099":"Yeah, I get it. You couldn't see me since I'm so short, you couldn't distinguish me from all the grains of sand. VERY FUNNY!!","1100":"I'll never show you my tears. These are the tears of those who died with regrets. If there's a way to take away these regrets, I'll make sure I'll find it.","1101":"People are capable of creating another part of themselves inside themselves at any time. A part that they can truly like.","1102":"I lost my pawns, my knight, my rook, my bishop, and even my queen. But, it's not checkmate, just yet.","1103":"But there's something a little sad about them [fireworks], too. They're so flashy, pretty and exciting, but as they fade, you feel sort of lonely.","1104":"I think that sometimes things just won't go the way we want them to. And every day there's bound to be something that makes us mad when there's nothing we can do to change the state of affairs. But that's not entirely true, either. We have to give these kinds of things some real thought as well. If we're sitting back and waiting for the future to arrive - we don't have anything invested in tomorrow. I don't want a tomorrow like that.","1105":"When there is evil in this world that justice cannot defeat, would you taint your hands with evil to defeat evil? Or would you remain steadfast and righteous even if it means surrendering to evil?","1106":"The whale leaps. As high as he can imagine. Piercing the water from peak to peak. Is a yearning for the sky reflected in his eyes? What if this high point wasn't merely the sky, but something far higher? If he knew of the infinite glitter of the stars, would his dreams soar even higher? Even if one doesn't know why, to live is to constantly reach out. Not to a nervous restlessness, but to a constant motion of the heart.","1107":"The weight of my sword is the weight of my pride. The wound from my battle with you is an honor, not a fetter.","1108":"Are you saddened by your lack of power, young one?","1109":"The human psyche goes out of whack so easily with minor elements, such as wall colors and staircase placement. Those who use them every day would be affected more dramatically.","1110":"...Have I... Stumbled upon a brand new shitty game again...?","1111":"To me, the world is not only the shape on the map. On the battle field, all I see are the faces of the order and my friends... I am an awful person aren't I? Instead of the real world, all I care about is my friends. That's because they are my whole world... Even if just one of my friends dies, to me, it's the same thing as part of the world being destroyed.","1112":"Tears are handy for washing away troubling and sad feelings. But when you grow up, you'll learn that there are things so sad, they can never be washed away by tears. That there are painful memories that should never be washed away. So people who are truly strong laugh when they want to cry. They endure all of the pain and sorrow while laughing with everybody else.","1113":"I've always lived in a world of deceit. And amidst the lies, I was able to find my true treasure.","1114":"Every power can be a poison or medicine depending on the user's intention.","1115":"I am who I am now because of everything that's happened. If I try to deny my past, I'm denying the person I've become. I don't want to do that.","1116":"People who call others stupid are usually more stupid. But I'm stupid, so I'll say it anyways...YOU'RE STUPID!","1117":"Even if I was someone, people couldn't comprehend me. And even if they could, they wouldn't be able to communicate it to those around them. I do not belong to the world. That is the world's limit, the boundary between the world and the self.","1118":"Did you not understand? All dreams eventually disappear when the dreamers wake.","1119":"Is being silent and suppressing  your own feelings really being thoughtful of the other person?","1120":"Don't be stupid. You're just a human. So back off, shut up, and butt out. *to Kagome*","1121":"There are so many weapons scattered across my path that it makes me wonder if this world is made of little more than lead and gunpowder.","1122":"\"Hero of Justice? A world where no one is hurt?\" Don't be absurd. \"Humanity\" is the name for an animal that cannot find joy in life without sacrifice. The pretty lie that is \"equality\" is nonsense spouted by weaklings who cannot look upon the darkness. Nothing but an excuse to cover up life's ugliness.","1123":"When you're just starting out, put all your energy into surviving. No matter how pathetic you feel, or how people laugh at you, if you come back alive, you win.","1124":"Welcome. Welcome to my cave young ones. Please forgive the belated salutations I am the holy sword Excalibur!","1125":"I led me by the hand, as if to fill the niches in the memories in my oozing brain fluid. Without even a destination, we kept walking. Disgusting clouds were floating in the sky. I already know what will happen to me the next time I wake up.","1126":"Fool! Next time you see the sun at night, know it's your last!","1127":"In life, nothing good comes out of hurrying.","1128":"No matter how you look, as long as your judgement is clouded you won't find the truth.","1129":"You're just too busy comparing yourself to others to see. Those comparisons aren't the only measure. Don't say it's all pointless. You've work hard and made yourself better. That's what you got in return. So don't put yourself down like this.","1130":"Apples taste so much better indoors.","1131":"I think I finally understand... As long as there's someone who'll grieve, it's wrong to want to die.","1132":"The truth is unattainable. It will always be shrouded in fog. Though you reach the murk and the gloom to grasp something, you have no means to know it is the truth. In which case, why...? What sense is there in yearning for the truth? Close your eyes. Lie to yourself. Live in blissful ignorance... it is a much smarter way to exist.","1133":"Sometimes it's necessary to courageously retreat.","1134":"The moment people come to know love, they run the risk of carrying hate.","1135":"You know, Okabe, whether time is slow or fast, depends on perception. Theory of relativity is so romantic.","1136":"This isn't divine jugdement. It's the work of some childish killer who's playing at divine retribution. That's all.","1137":"Illegal contractees kill people to be able to change the past.","1138":"I'm Hatake Kakashi. Things I like and things I hate? I don't feel like telling you that. My dreams for the future? Never really thought about that. As for my hobbies... I have lots of hobbies.","1139":"99% of perception that normal humans have are closed off. Those who don't think of themselves are quite foolish beings.","1140":"It\u2019s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.","1141":"If I'm going to disappear no matter what, I at least want to leave them having fun and smiling.","1142":"I should use a cheerful joke to lighten the mood. Would you like a snack? Or, maybe I should snack on you instead?","1143":"He is so twisted that if he sees someone wandering around lost, he's the kind of guy who will screw and toy around with the poor soul before he even bothers to help...IF he even bothers to help!","1144":"Those who seek out the truth must not be arrogant. You must not laugh at miracles just because they cannot be explained scientifically. You must not turn away from the beauty of this world.","1145":"Who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil? The mirror does not reflect evil, but creates it.","1146":"Ha ha! Eat my dust, rat-boy! (to Yuki)","1147":"[Talking about Hueco Mundo] There isn't even water! Huh? Then how'd we have tea earlier?","1148":"The brain is a microcosm, creating its own stories. People then live out these stories.","1149":"Your unconditional trust is more than I'm willing to bear.","1150":"This might come a little late but... you people make me sick.","1151":"I'm afraid when something is truly lost, one can never get it back again.","1152":"[telling Mustang about the investigation on Scar] His bloodstained clothes washed up further downstream. We don't know if that means that he's dead, or just naked.","1153":"[after learning Guy Sensei's name. Might Guy] Yeah, mighty stupid looking guy!","1154":"Once my stomach settles down... You better be prepared, 'cause we'll really give you something to cry about in the mat... ugh... ch... uughh...","1155":"Real friends wouldn't use you for your money. I don't have any friends, so I'm no expert, but I'd rather have no friends than have friends like them.","1156":"I don\u2019t like someone who makes a fool out of earnest people.","1157":"It is meaningless to distinguish between the beautiful and the ugly, or between the talented and the ordinary. Every human struggles to survive.","1158":"Living has it own challenges. I'll give you just one piece of advice. Don't quit. Yes, when you die, you die. But if you give up, you're definitely going to die. That, I am sure of.","1159":"I was younger then, I wasn't afraid of anything, I didn't think about dying for a second. I thought I was invincible. Then I met some girl. I wanted to live, I started to think like that; for the first time I was afraid of death. I had never felt like that before.","1160":"Even with no magical powers\u2026 I\u2019ll become the magic emperor.","1161":"Stop being such a bitch, Sweden!","1162":"Humming and the nightly news share a very tight connection indeed.","1163":"And so... I have written down the lesson I've learned from this vital experience in form of a title suitable for a business reference book: \"Never hold meetings. The outcome is determined before the meeting begins.\"","1164":"Besides, it doesn't really matter, does it? Why should I care about appearances and labels anyway. It's what's on the inside that counts.","1165":"Holding in your own feelings like that... ye think tha' no one's gonna get hurt since ye're not lettin' it show to anyone? Tha's just the same as goin' 'round hurting everyone anyway!! What ye're doin' isn't ye keepin' everyone dear to ye!! Ye're just protectin' yerself!!! Ye're just 'fraid of gettin' hurt! Losin' yer nerve! Ye're just scared!!","1166":"Becoming an adult is such a sad thing. If you have something dear to protect, you may end up at odds with yourself.","1167":"Many things can be achieved, as long as you believe in it.","1168":"We have to find a way to face this scar.","1169":"The most inflated egos are often the most fragile.","1170":"Isn't using the net just like using knives for cooking or using paper to write things down? It has nothing to do with good or bad. It's like, it's there, so we accept and use it.","1171":"Nice speech, Azula! It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way!","1172":"For murderers, there is no good or evil. I know that.","1173":"To me, nothing is painful. There is no such thing as anguish. Even if some things seem like they hurt, deep down, everyone is a nice person. We can understand each other, or so I thought; or so I liked to think. I didn't want to wallow in misery. I didn't want to become spiteful. I just didn't want to be hurt. I didn't want to be hated.","1174":"The impostor is an impostor because it can't be distinguished from the real thing. The proof of its falsity is in its resemblance to the real thing.","1175":"In the first place, the logic that says \"those who play games are kids\" is itself an allusion, therefore one might say that shoehorning reality into your stubborn dualism is already a criticism of the self. In short, humans can only recognize reality through the filter called \"me\" and so they are unable to escape the constraints of their uncanny existence.","1176":"\"Are you prepared to die?\". Most astronauts answer with a simple \"yes\", but you can say anything. It's just a weak yes. You shouldn't be prepared to die. Instead, you should have the resolve to live until the very end! If there's someone who replies \"no\", you can trust them.","1177":"People tend to show off their act of kindness.

Which do you think is more fortunate? I think it might not be that bad living in the dark, remembering the light.","1200":"People cannot change the past. All we can do, is accept our own actions. If you still wish to be burdened by your sins, let it show in your future actions.

Head spin!","1210":"So you feel like you're being dishonest or something? That's not true. It's a great thing to come to like someone. If you ask me...

I was from District 79, \"Kusajishi\", of the North Alley of Rukongai. I had never seen anything in colors other than the bloody red... Everyone was more beast than human. It wouldn't have been strange to have a baby get stepped on and die. But then you appeared. From District 80, \"Zaraki\", of the North Alley of Rukongai. You appeared to me from even deeper in the darkness. You demolished the chaotic world that was dyed in blood... And then, you gave me a name. If it wasn't for you...I wouldn't be alive today. Yes...Since that day...You've been everything to me in this world.","1213":"If you pity my existence, please eat me.","1214":"Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored.

Mu La Flaga?","1224":"There are all sorts of goodbyes. There are sad goodbyes, and sometimes goodbyes you're thankful for, that take a load off your mind. It often happens that someone you say goodbye to unexpectedly returns, all self-conscious.

And if you should forget about that, then what did we fight the revolution for?","1273":"\"Believing in someone.\" That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn't need to say, \"I believe you.\" It's like saying, \"I believe in air.\" I don't mean to say that \"believing in something\" is like a lie. \"Believing\" is really a term of hope of wanting to believe.","1274":"Once I'm dead, I won't even be able to remember you.

Now that I think about it, it\u2019s almost strange. Why don\u2019t most people try to kill other people? How can they just stand by and let the scum have their way without the slightest indifference? Maybe my expectations were too high. I\u2019m only disappointed because I expected something from them. But the answer was quite simple all along. There\u2019s no such thing as a decent human being in this world. Not a single one. I did what I had to do. And I feel quite refreshed after doing it. That\u2019s why I can say that this world could afford to be a little more chaotic.","1286":"People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever.

Never be captivated by anyone, just live for yourself.","1295":"In order to obtain something, there must be something of equal value. It is the Law of Conservation in Alchemy. Back then, we believed that it was the truth of the world. However, the real world isn\u2019t perfect, so there is not just a single law that governs everything that happens within it. It is the same for the Law of Conservation in Alchemy. Even so, I believe that people cannot obtain something without paying a price. The pain we felt was surely enough of a price to pay. And anyone who pays the price known as hard work surely gains something. The Law of Conservation is not the law governing this \nworld.

If you try to twist it against its will\u2026 You\u2019ll be punished.","1307":"Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.","1308":"I am ME. No matter, what I say or do, I'm still ME.

Time gives us happiness, but it can also take everything away from us.

Come on! STRIKE ME! You've never held back before!","1324":"The Present is ending. Here, countless versions of our past selves are always crying, laughing, falling in love, getting hurt, joking around, feeling happy and suffering. These feelings are born all the time and in the next moment, they became the past and die. It's over now. This is the end, but the truth is everyone's time is like that. Right after it's born, every moment becomes the past and dies.","1325":"A miracle never comes to those who seek it.","1326":"What I hate the most in the world is when I'm already trying hard and I'm told to try harder!","1327":"Uh, my name... is...

No one can promise they\u2019ll be together forever.","1342":"I think I would like someone else to kill me. I want someone else to interfere with my life. Is that not what wanting to be loved means, Saikawa-sensei? No life is born of it's own volition.

Only the ordinary.","1348":"I understand now. Even if I must take the devil's fruit, I must gain power. I am an avenger.","1349":"For some time researchers have understood that moderate stress has beneficial effects. It boosts the immune system for example. Stress motivates and prepares us for action. It compels our body to survive. However, routine psycho pass checks take away the stress from us. There are patients whose stress reaction is so numb, they can\u2019t even recognize the basic stimulation of their senses. Once that happens, it\u2019s a neurological downward spiral, they become like living corpses.

No one, no one ever has the right to take the life of another. No one. And everyone, everyone deserves a future. Don't you think that's true? Please, please, it's time to stop the fighting now. It's up to us to end the cycle of hatred. If we don't work to end the sorrow this time, then the cycle of pain will just continue on. When we were all born, were any of us made to steal or cause others harm?","1375":"I've told you before, he's not one to trust, Otae-san. No trustworthy man has eyes that look like a dead fish's eyes.","1376":"It's not about doing what it takes to win. Sei-chan told me before \"Winning is just like breathing\". Victory isn't something that Sei-chan seeks. It's a natural part of his life. It's a basic bodily function.","1377":"Trying to knock others down a peg just means lowering yourself. Don't go trampling all the hardwork and trust you've build up. It insults the effort you put in.","1378":"Our contracts are completely dependent upon you agreeing to them first. I think that, in and of itself, is quite kind of us.","1379":"The melody of logic always plays the notes of truth.","1380":"L, do you know gods of death love apples?","1381":"That hot dog must've fried your brain!","1382":"*To the twins* We've had enough of this! You're both to blame for this fight! Hika-chan and Kao-chan, I want you to make up and go halfsies on this cake, okay? But, I want to have a piece too, so I guess we're gonna have to go thirdsies. We're not going to be able to split the strawberry on top though. What should we do? Maybe I should just take it. After all, strawberries are my favorite. Oh, I forgot to ask, Hika-chan, Kao-chan, do you like strawberries?","1383":"The world lies! Thou shalt not commit murder, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not cheat, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. All of these are lies! Mere illusions and nothing more! They don't want to be killed, they don't want to be robbed, using the twin lies of justice and morality, the weak are endeavoring to protect themselves. But the first truth is that the strong devour the weak, so let us feed upon people, upon wealth, upon riches and power! We, at Britannia, shall feast upon the raw flesh of the world itself! We will crush this deception and bring forth the truth!

It's my job, no one else's! I'll bear the burden of your hatred... and we'll die together!","1387":"Often times in memory, we have the tendency to overly romanticize the people we care about.","1388":"It's not that I hate the person in front of me. If I had met him under different circumstances, this never would have happened. But I did meet him that day, and now there is no turning back. I must distinguish the difference between past and present. Everything must be left behind, and the man in front of me is the wall; the wall that I must break through. There is only one direction for me to go. I have to move forward. That's what I'm thinking...","1389":"You play like you're jacking off. [about Ryuu playing piano]","1390":"Life eventually ends. But that doesn't mean that the fact that we met, or the time we spent together will disappear.","1391":"[to Athrun] What is it you believe in? What is it you're fighting for now? Is it for that medal you received? Or your father's orders?","1392":"The reason the Yamadas get along fine is because all three adults are nuts. If one of you were normal it would unbalance the rest.","1393":"I won't ask what you wish for. I only hope it comes true by your own two hands. (to Kyo)","1394":"...If Tohru-chan were to die, I...I wonder if I'd be able to smile again one year later? Or if I'd wish that I could forget ever having met her. ...Tohru-chan... has tried really hard...","1395":"We all live under the same sky. If each of us learns to shine, it won't matter how far apart we are. We'll be able to see each other.","1396":"You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too. To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity.","1397":"I shall cleanse away thy bitterness...","1398":"It isn't just \"others\". Not \"others\". It's my Family. I'll force my ideals on my family. And since they're family, I'll lie to them. I'll deceive them. I'll cause them trouble. I'll make them worry. I'll owe them things, things I'll never be able to repay. However, I think that's okay. If you say that being an impostor is evil, then I will shoulder the burden of that evil. If lying is a bad thing, then I'm fine being the bad person. I don't need them to like me. I'm fine with being the worst kind of person.","1399":"And the TV show ended by saying how young people are becoming increasingly illiterate, but doesn't browsing the Internet and blogging actually improve your literacy?","1400":"When you love someone, sometimes your head hurts. And it's so agonizing that you want to burst into tears. But even the smallest thing can bring you happiness. It's complicated, but simple. Perhaps all these emotions are irreplaceable and precious.","1401":"Emotions? Nope, I've got nothin' like that. I told you when we first met, didn't I? I'm a snake. With cold skin, no emotions, that slithers around searching for prey with its tongue, swallowing down whatever looks tasty.","1402":"No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside something warm and precious always remains, something that never changes. To me, that\u2019s what family is like.","1403":"The\u2018present is a leaf floating on top of the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future.","1404":"After all.. love is all about timing.

Even if you regret it, it'll be too late.","1405":"There isn't just one truth out there, everyone carries their own form of it","1406":"Between dreams and reality is the vault of your soul.

Life's too short.","1408":"A lump of steel, like a shooting star. Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different. I swing between hope and despair at your slightest gesture, and my heart starts to play a melody. What kind of feeling is this again? What do they call this kind of feeling? I think it's probably... Called Love. I'm sure this is what they call love.","1409":"Is it wrong to do stuff by yourself? If someone worked hard on their own until now, why do they have to face rejection here?","1410":"The world doesn't get to decide whether my life is boring, fun, or ordinary, because that's my decision to make. As long as I have the will, nothing is impossible!","1411":"I want to hear who you are, not what you have.","1412":"I don't want others to hear the words that I've been waiting anxiously for... I want to be the only one to hear them.","1413":"Everything you've been taught is based on theories and logic. Soon you will likely come to realize how pointless they are in the world we live in.","1414":"Like God, you mean? That might be pleasurable in its own way, but unfortunately I'm not into being an umpire or a referee, as I can't genuinely enjoy the game unless I'm part of it. And I love this game that people call \"life\" from the bottom of my heart. That's why I'd like to continue to participate in it as a player, forever and ever.","1415":"Revenge never does anyone any good. Killing the person you hate will never ease the pain.

And I have done nothing but ignore him!","1418":"You should use your strength to help others.","1419":"Maybe worrying about the future partings so much that you miss out on happiness in the present is a waste.","1420":"Just as no matter how hard you try to keep it away, despair will attack you again and again.

Again and again.","1421":"Celebrating Mr. Jesus's birthday (Christmas) was fun, why don't we celebrate Buddha's and Muhammad's birthday next time?","1422":"There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer.

You know how humans love to watch other people suffer while making fools of themselves. I mean, why else would you constantly be at war with each other?","1425":"Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control.

I'll even watch you on your death bed. I am no stranger to death. But your heart is like that of an innocent child. It has always accepted everything about me, without hesitation. Because of that I am very afraid.","1456":"You try to sound like you think things through, when in fact, you're not thinking at all.","1457":"Unfortunately, I don't have a nice eyeball like you, that can see this and that. All I can do to pursue one thing in front of me. So whether it's the abyss of death or an empty void, I won't fight for the manju offered to my grave. I'll fight for tomorrow's breakfast.

You're normally caring, normally cheerful, and you're normally nosy. You've a strong moral compass, concern for your friends, and honor. I know you don't see this, but what's normal to you, well it's far from it. Everyone else would call it courageous and noble. It's because of the person you are that you don't think twice about your own safety when it comes to helping your friends. 'Cause that's just normal to you.","1463":"People like us aren't qualified to be involved in a dramatic incident such as a suicide. No matter how depressed you are or how much pain you're in, you have to return to your routine, daily life. Even if you don't come back, you'll just end up dying in vain. A dramatic death isn't befitting of us.","1464":"When faced with a decision... At such times, we must choose only one option and it can be very confusing. When that happens, simply using your head and charging straight into the obstacle is a fine option.","1465":"Alright already, you had me at shut up.","1466":"Can you understand?

You have to grab your own happiness!","1473":"Our hearts beat in the same rhythm, so why does time flow differently for the two of us?","1474":"Any time one isn't familiar with something, it all looks the same. Knowledge and education are required to properly judge a thing.","1475":"Well, I like to look at myself in my spare time.","1476":"You guys sure are a worthless bunch. If you wanna wallow in your tears, save it for after you've done everything you can!","1477":"However, I can't be happy. I feel I can't have that experience, I can't assume I will have that experience. I'm free, but feeling lonely and disheartened. I hope there's happiness out there.

But I have to wonder though... is that voice a result of fiddling around with her genes?","1488":"Every brilliant day should be lived for those who passed away.","1489":"I don't let anyone in my sight get away, and my bullets never miss their mark. Especially if it's the heart of a beautiful lady... BANG.","1490":"Give a man a break, and you'll end up broken.","1491":"You may be able to get stronger with simply the right attitude. In other words, train your spirit before worrying about strength through power and technology.","1492":"Life and death are the very basis of all things. They intensify every emotion.

Got it, Kuchiki?","1496":"A guy who likes someone else shouldn't be taking care of the girl he just dumped.","1497":"If it's a wish that can be fulfilled, then fulfill it.

Don't leave things in the fridge.","1502":"Never beg and earn by winning or else you won't get anything.","1503":"Look, look around carefully. Strain your eyes. At the darkness around us... At the darkness... around me. You said, \"anywhere but here\". This is where. Here at the border. Gathered by the winds. Those who've met their final destiny hanging between jealousy and regret. Those who failed, swept together here. You say \"It doesn't matter where\". If you follow me, this is where you'll go! This is your Eden!\n\nYou run from it. It is no Eden.\nIf you follow me... to this place... the entire world... is a battlefield.","1504":"People's feelings sometimes go astray and lead to irreversible consequences.","1505":"[thinking after Soifon asks why she didn't take her with her] You've gotten stronger since the last time we were together, Soifon.","1506":"If it's going to be a relationship of hardship and mental agony, you should put an end to it.","1507":"Farewell, warrior of the sky.

Your staying alive is the only proof that Teresa ever existed.","1516":"There's a lot of products that you can buy with money...but my love is the only limited product that only you can have.","1517":"Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives meaning to his life. Even if the dream ruins his life, man cannot allow himself to leave it behind. In this world, is man ever able to possess anything more solid, than a dream?","1518":"Sometimes people put up walls, not to keep others out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.","1519":"Your high school life will be over before you know it. There are things you can only do now. You should do as many of them as you can.","1520":"Are you a coward...OR ARE YOU A MAN OF AMERICA?!","1521":"What took a very long time to build up takes mere moments to destroy.

We have protected everything as just three people. We're the Yorozuya.","1536":"Why are people born? If people are born only to suffer the hard life, is it meant as some kind of punishment? Or a cynical joke? If that's the case, animals that adhere to the survival strategies programmed in their DNA are far more elegant and simple. If there really is an existence worthy of being called a God, I want to ask him just one thing: Is there really fate in the universe? If a man ignored fate, and ignored his instincts and DNA to love someone else... Dear God, is he really human? Just wondering. I hate the word \"fate\".","1537":"You mongrels. By our next meeting see that you've culled your numbers. Only a true hero is worthy to look upon my glorious presence.","1538":"What do you know of death?!! Have you ever died?!!

If I want to know what lies upon the deep ocean floors\u2026 I would have to open my eyes in the stagnant water. Then swim downwards while enduring the icy deep kicking through the cold and heavy ocean waters. If I truly want to know the human known as myself\u2026.even if.. there is nothing there.","1562":"Waiting for you. Waiting for your knock. The only thing that stands between us is a single door. Shining\nmy shoes and placing a piece of eternally fresh bread in my pocket, I prepare for my journey.\nWhen you're ready, just look up at me.  Right now, I'm just waiting for you...Waiting for your knock.","1563":"What are you, some tantrum throwing brat who forgot to buy his Jump? Having no money is like having a sinus infection. You just have to ignore it and not pick at it, and it'll go away.","1564":"There are times like that music can convey more than words.","1565":"Listen to your seniors once in a while or I will kill you.","1566":"I won't live my life by another person's script.","1567":"Truth can change its form depending on the observer.","1568":"Well, I give up. Can't win against fools.","1569":"All I ever gained from abandoning something and running away were regrets I couldn't do anything about, and a version of myself that could only resent others. If I come to hate myself, even living becomes a sin. Remorse alone will become my punishment. That's why I've decided to take action of my own free will, so I'll never have the same regrets again.","1570":"Lies are like colours. The more you pile up, the blacker things get.","1571":"Get a hold of yourself, you\u2019re an adult aren\u2019t you?","1572":"People aren't born social. Sure it comes easier to some people... but most people, like you, need to work at it. Some more than others. You're just inexperienced. For example, as a martial artist, you have the strength to break the table with your fist. But you also have the self-control to stop your fist right before it hits the table. You weren't born with that control, were you? You had to refine it. It's the same as interacting with people. But training for that isn't in the mountains - it has to be in town where people live. Mingling with people, hurting them, getting hurt by them. That's how you learn about people and about yourself. If you don't, you'll never care about anyone but yourself. You may be a black belt fighter, but you're still a white belt in dealing with people. For the sake of the girl who will one day tell you she loves you... Don't turn away. Keep training.","1573":"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but to atone for that you got mad and decided to do this alone? Rem... Super slap! For starters, are you dumb? No, you are dumb! Listen, where I'm from there's a saying, \"3 heads are better than 1.\" Wait, is it 2 heads? Whatever, the point is, 3 heads, thinking together are harder to break than only 1 arrow. It means you should rely on those around you instead of thinking about stuff alone!","1574":"If you could calculate feelings, then we'd be in a digital age by now... The remaining answer that you couldn't calculate is what they call the feelings of people.","1575":"Shinpachi, just remember this... We aren't friends with justice or even your sister. We're YOUR friends.","1576":"I won't ever be the best at anything. Or rather, you might say that I've stopped trying to be.","1577":"The world you can see isn't all out there. In the world there are a lot of fascinating things that no living soul has ever seen! And just in knowing that is one cause for happiness. I'm sure you can find happiness meant for you! It might be something you might not quite understand yet. But you'll find it, that much is certain!","1578":"I have told you before, I'm an avenger. I don't care about this test, Chunin or whatever. 'Am I strong?' that's the answer I want.","1579":"True power is forged from the desire smoldering in the heart, it fans into a flame and begins to burn with an intensity one scarcely imagines to be possible...","1580":"Never forget who you are, for surely the world won't.","1581":"His soul was as pure as snow.","1582":"When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.","1583":"FOOL! As someone who is unaware of the vital role that singing has played in the cultural history of mankind you are in no position to question me. Remember that the next time you stop to consider your place in this world. You do not possess the power to deny a singer his song. Do you understand what I'm telling you?","1584":"Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras! Chakras, chakras! Chakra sandwich tastes good! Yum!","1585":"Don\u2019t underestimate me! Besides, even if you\u2019re just acting, even if you\u2019re an upperclassman","1586":"Everybody loves somebody. In time, everybody falls in love with somebody. Just as I found you.","1587":"This is how culture spreads. When someone has a new idea, it is immediately copied.","1588":"It is the path you have chosen. Take pride in it.","1589":"Don't you know that fans only make flames stronger?","1590":"Against the power of will I posses... The capability of my body is nothing.","1591":"There's only one world for us, and things in it are set up so that we can find happiness in it.","1592":"This is your world. As an outsider it may be out of place to say this... But I want to make one thing clear: Mere observers have no right to decide the future!","1593":"Sorry, Aizen-sama. I got caught.","1594":"In this world, nobody is free. Even the flying birds are chained to the sky.","1595":"I still can't control my wish to see her. I never thought of how important she was to me. (about Rin)","1596":"I'm sure that things that are truly fun can't be compared. Back then, now, and from now on, in the time you spend with others, lots of small fun things are born and disappear. If you are able to capture each of them, you'll never run out of fun things. Forever and ever. And here's one point of advice. Thinking that now is fun is what makes it the most fun.","1597":"I can't let myself not like the person I like.","1598":"The stray dog in me is dyed into my bones... All I do is howl at the moon, but I don't have the guts to bite...","1599":"You couldn't save your mom because you... weren't strong enough. I didn't face the Titan... because I wasn't brave enough.","1600":"Fighting without hope is no way to live. It's just a way to die.","1601":"Sometimes, it's necessary to look back at the past in order to move on to the future.","1602":"Once you meet someone, you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memory to come back to you.","1603":"*To himself, while fighting Temari* Oh man... those clouds are so lucky. so free. More to the point, I didn't feel like doing this in the first place. And I only became a ninja because I thought life would've been more interesting as one... I suppose things aren't gonna be that simple.","1604":"If you feel yourself hitting up against your limit, remember for what cause you clench your fists! Remember why you started down this path, and let that memory carry you beyond your limit.","1605":"Do you think it's possible to send Flame Alchemy through the phone and burn someones ears off?","1606":"I don't know how to give up!!","1607":"They say when you fall, it's best to fall straight to the bottom, and the farther you have to crawl back up, the stronger and greater you'll be as a result.","1608":"Tohru, you must always be yourself and do things at your own pace. Someday... you'll catch up.","1609":"I'm too young to die!","1610":"This area feels weird, it's been throbbing hard since that time. When you told me not to go. When you held me so tight. It won't go away. Your voice is still in my ear. What happened to me? Is this... love?","1611":"I wanted to tell you that\u2026 Wherever you may end up in this world, I will be searching for you.","1612":"If there are things you learn with friends, there must also be things you learn without friends. They must be of equal worth, two sides of the same coin.","1613":"There is a meaning for wings that cannot fly! It's a precious memory of when you once flew in the sky.","1614":"If you can't understand the darkness in your opponent's heart, you will never comprehend the pain and suffering of others.","1615":"99% of perception that normal humans have are closed off. Those who don\u2019t think of themselves are quite foolish beings.","1616":"Stake your lives on this fight! Our survival demands that we stake our lives on this fight! And to survive, is to be victorious!","1617":"Good evening, Espada. There has been an enemy attack. But first...Let us brew some tea.","1618":"Leave her out of this... who we let in this house is really none of your concern. You're the one who doesn't belong here. (to Kyo)","1619":"We will never laugh at ourselves. Just as earthworms do not fear darkness and penguins are not ashamed of their inability to fly. That's the meaning of life, is it not?","1620":"So I'll search for my real ''wings'', because if I stay in the comfort of my nest, I'll never be able to use my own strength to fly.","1621":"The idea that you can't die yet because you still have something to protect... that is the foolish illusion of the weak.","1622":"If you use him, you\u2019ll get rid of all the curses nearby in a flash.","1623":"This is the end of my dream. My wings forgot how to fly, since I only kept pretending to flap them. Is there a meaning to wings that can't fly?","1624":"A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.","1625":"[Fuu passed out after one drink and is asleep] Sleeping so carelessly. I could do something to you so easily.","1626":"Fortunately, I do not have any pride. But what about it? Will the name of the hero be disgraced? Hah, don't make me laugh, Lancer. You can wash away disgrace with results. You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs.","1627":"As they say about the vulgar masses, the more people flock to a group, the more foolish they become. No matter how prominent an individual is, no, it\u2019s because he is prominent that he would be blotted out by the sheer force of numbers when thrown into that lump of people. Individual will, qualifications, and personality, let alone emotions aren\u2019t considered at all.\nWe see only what we want to see, listen only to what we want to listen to, but for the things we want to say, we aren\u2019t able to. This is the society that we\u2019re living in right now.","1628":"You hit me with everything you had, so I decided I could trust you with everything I had.","1629":"Now I got some common sense for you,if I wore a tie, it wouldn't change who I am, if I had no piercings it wouldn't mean I'm nice, and if my hair was black it wouldn't stop me from kicking your ass!","1630":"Fine. I'll correct myself. I have no experience. I'm a virgin. More to the point, the only kind of girl who'd talk to an unappealing virgin like you are late-bloomer virgins like me!","1631":"Your past shouldn't stop you from achieving your goals and dreams.","1632":"If you keep my secret, this strawberry is yours.","1633":"There is no greater accomplishment in life than pushing yourself to the limit, always! Isn\u2019t that so? That\u2019s all there is to it!","1634":"If you believe it was destined to happen it is most likely to happen, if you believe nothing has been decided then most likely nothing has been decided.","1635":"Chasing someone is tiring, and being chased is mentally exhausting. But making someone chase you can be fun.","1636":"That's how Sokka started. Now look at him! He thinks he's an Earthbender!","1637":"Don't think that the me tomorrow will be the same as the me today. You'd better be careful.","1638":"There\u2019s no knowing how others are feeling unless you ask them. And your feelings can\u2019t get through to others unless you tell them directly.","1639":"Mistakes are not shackles that halt one from stepping forward. Rather, they are that which sustain and grow one's heart.","1640":"He won't play up to anyone. He won't be led astray by anything. He simply places himself in a clear space.","1641":"In order to achieve something there are some things that you have to be unsatisfied with in the first place. Having a complex is the source to greatness.","1642":"The guards will show you to your chamber. The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!","1643":"The bird fights it's way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born, must first destroy a world.","1644":"The winner should not question his victory. If anything, your actions were responsible for making your own luck.","1645":"Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and the ability to think. Learning how to survive, that's our trait as humans! The human species can't use magic and can't even perceive it\u2014but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it! We don't have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable\u2014to predict the future...Rejoice! We are humans; we are the most talented people! Precisely because we were born without any ability, we can achieve anything. This is the will of the weakest race!","1646":"Opportunities wait for no one! If you let an opportunity slip through your fingers with an excuse like, \u201cI wasn't prepared.\u201d You'll never get another opportunity like that again! But it is your life. Live it the way you want.","1647":"Dangerous toys are fun, but you can get hurt.","1648":"The beauty of the stars never changes. However, stars that change are beautiful as well.","1649":"I don't know if you noticed, but you just called him \"Captain.\"","1650":"Make one peep and I will rape you.","1651":"Kakarot! Dodge this next attack, if you can!.. But even if I miss you... THIS WHOLE PLANET'S GOING UP IN SMOOOOKE!","1652":"*To Tayuya* How many times do I have to tell you? The first move is always a feint. It's the most basic thing, to land a hit with the second move.","1653":"Up, up! Down, down! Left, right, left, right! Bringing the motherfucking death by Konami! Ahh I'm so fucking hard right now! [laughs]","1654":"[to Karin] Do as your heart desires! Jump into your father's bosom!","1655":"...The act of taking is equally evil. We, from the moment of birth, continue to take. Food, connections, even fellow blood. Living to utmost. Continuing to slaughter, kill, take. Life is to constantly sin. Life is evil itself. I am aware I am evil... And so are you all. Now, come kill me. And I shall do the same!","1656":"To a girl, a man who\u2019s nice to everyone... hm, I suppose that works as an example, to a man, it would be like a woman who opens her legs to anyone. People want companions so they can swiftly satisfy their need for love and affection. A woman wants a man who only shows his love to her.","1657":"Kuwabara, come back! You're like an ugly singer with a good voice, best for backup!","1658":"I do not hate you. However, to protect our peaceful existence, there is no other way!","1659":"So many faces looking like they're thinking even though they're not. So disgusting.","1660":"Vision is not what your eyes see, but an image that your brain comprehends.","1661":"Know that the only people you can save like that are the ones that survive.","1662":"The\"'present\" is a leaf floating on top of the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future.","1663":"Instead of picking fruit when it's green, you should wait, wait, and wait until it ripens. When they reach their peak, you pick them off! Even though the action itself is the same, they taste totally different.","1664":"Don't worry. When people break their old selves they embark a journey to find their new selves.","1665":"The one hundred years we were apart were meant to bring me power and make you weak! Yoruichi!","1666":"It's okay, cool guys see naked women all the time, I'm totally used to it.","1667":"I can't just leave a crying girl alone and go home. I'm too wimpy to carry you, but I can lend you a shoulder, and get you down the stairs.","1668":"That's exactly the way it should be. Doing only unexpected things, otherwise, I'll lose my reputation as a perverted outer-space human.","1669":"And it seems you've acquired a new power. However, is that all you are capable of achieving with it? This is the end. You will no longer interfere. The sun has already set in our hands.","1670":"Once a person is ready to die, anything is possible.","1671":"Effort is nothing but a means to an end. Being proud of the fact that you tried is just putting the carriage before the horse.","1672":"If you think it's natural for people to sacrifice their own lives to save others, surely you understand that sometimes a single death can save many lives.","1673":"I'm a little grateful to you. I wonder if I'll forget these feelings too.","1674":"*to Riku* At least I'm the cute one!!","1675":"There's a noose that hangs at the entrance to the city. It's a message to be read by all who encounter it. For the cautious, the sane - it's a warning. For the reckless, the wild at heart - an invitation they cannot refuse. The worst of the criminal underworld gather here. They come here from across the world to butt heads and jostle for power. An evil city caught between the east and the west founded during the Cold War and nurtured by many who came here to ride the wave of the illegal drug trade sweeping across the continent. The edge of the world, the crucible of hypocrisy, a place where those whose souls have been destroyed in the relentless search for money and power reside. A final stop on the way to hell. How have I managed to stay alive this long? With the help of three people: Dutch, Revy and Benny. Also known as the Lagoon Company. The name of this city is spoken of among the villains of the world. Many who come here to make a name for themselves are swallowed by the darkness, never to return. A cruel fate awaits any half-assed small time crook, who accidentally stumbles into Roanapur. Right now another sacrificial lamb has wandered too far from home. The city awaits.","1676":"It was an egg-cident! Get it? 'Egg?","1677":"Nobody will admire you just because you are strong. People respect the ones that choose the difficult path, even if they're weak.","1678":"Isn't it funny how the most unforgettable scenes can be so trivial ?","1679":"I've been trying so hard... Even though you rejected me, I've been trying my best. But if I go on liking you like this then nothing will change.","1680":"Listen, Haku. I don\u2019t remember it, but my mom told me... Once, when I was little, I fell into a river. She said they\u2019d drained it and built things on top. But I\u2019ve just remembered. The river was called the Kohaku River. Your real name is... Kohaku.","1681":"I'm pleased to meet you at last, L Number Two.","1682":"If you live life by other people's standards, then your life is no longer yours.","1683":"When one person kills, resentment is born. That resentment makes a person kill again. To sever that vicious cycle--that is the purpose of this sword that cannot kill.","1684":"As the survivors, we carry the feelings of those who've passed away on our shoulders.","1685":"I\u2019m not going to lie to you, Vegeta, although the answer may be difficult for you to hear. This is the truth. Goku devoted his life to protecting the lives of other. Because of his selflessness, when he died, he was allowed to keep his body and travel to King Kai\u2019s Planet. You, on the other hand, have spent your life in pursuit of your own selfish desires. You\u2019ve caused too much pain. When you die, you will not receive the same reward.","1686":"I\u2019m not gonna be your worthless punching bag-Deku forever\u2026 Kacchan, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m the Deku who always does his best!","1687":"Believe in yourself... If you don\u2019t have that... it doesn\u2019t matter how many talents you have, you still won\u2019t be able to hold your head up high...","1688":"A joke only lasts for a moment, if it leaves a misunderstanding, it becomes a lie.","1689":"It's frightening that there's no guarantee that I'll ever be loved.","1690":"Oddities are the world itself. They're linked to the world, unlike living beings. Science alone cannot shed light upon them, as there will always be people who'll be afraid of vampires. Although all forms of darkness could be lit up, darkness will never cease to exist.","1691":"\"I long to see someone who died\", \"I want to be rich\", \"I want women\", \"I want to protect the world\"... They're all desires. In other words, wishes. If you ask me, there's neither \"right\" or \"wrong\" when it comes to greed. You humans go around ranking certain types of greed in order from good to bad, which makes you so hard to understand.","1692":"Time is not money. You can't buy time, now can you?","1693":"Why is it that the beautiful things are entwined more deeply with death than with life?","1694":"You can take a picture of something and it never does it justice... I think about that sometimes when I see a picture of you.","1695":"You want to kill me? You couldn't even kill my boredom!","1696":"I guess, as long as I have life, all I can do is fight with all my might.","1697":"If they find out what you did there, a lot of people will say a lot of things to you. Some will say you did the right thing. And some will say you did the wrong thing. But that's not what matters. No matter what anyone says, you don't have to worry. Because you didn't do the right thing, and you didn't do the wrong thing. It was all part of being young.","1698":"It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.","1699":"A perfect plan doesn't mean having everything go within expectations. A perfect plan is achieved when it has the plasticity needed to flexibly deal with troubles.","1700":"Risking my life for European politics would make me grassy!","1701":"Once you find out whom you made the promise to, will you really be able to fall in love with her?","1702":"Shut up! I did what I had to do. People lie to survive. No one is blameless.","1703":"Mu, I'd actually be pleased if you'd vanish right about now!","1704":"\"Obey the ones with power\". That's the true meaning of the law of the jungle. If you don't wish to be bound by that, obtain greater power. Because there's always times one must fight power with power.","1705":"No matter how hard you practice, \"someday\" and \"maybe\" aren't good enough. I need to know if you have ambitious goals and the will to accomplish them.","1706":"Charging from the front isn't the only way to cross a wall. If pushing doesn't work, why not try pulling? Try thinking from the opposite direction, you might be able to find a new way out.","1707":"If you were in this situation, what would you have done? You would run after Byakuya...And then kick him in the butt, right? No matter how one captain complains, the Central Government won't change their decision for one person. But if it was you, you would still run around appealing to save Kuchiki...No. You would probably do something completely different. You always chose the path that lead to the most danger. Am I right...Kaien?","1708":"There's is no such thing as a useless player.","1709":"Does math bring out your wrath?","1710":"I like fish, biiiig FISH. I also have a crap haircut, kinda like Naruto.","1711":"I would solve a friend's problem... then also find a way to keep them from ending up with a new one.","1712":"Excalibur! Excalibur! From the United K! I'm looking for heaven! I'm going to California!","1713":"The choice we're making might be one of evil as well. For we call for peace, but with weapons in our hands. Nevertheless, allow us to break of endless conflict. Give us strength.","1714":"If we're going to win, we might as well get the best deal out of it in the process.","1715":"If you think too hard when you don't have a brain, you're going to hurt your head.","1716":"It's not because the game was so interesting, that everyone's trying to ask sensei about it. But it's because sensei's interesting, so the students are talking about the game with him.","1717":"The more you rush, the less careful you become. Even a cautious rat will show its tail.","1718":"I'm not sure why I've decided to do this. I'm not any stronger than I was, and nothing else has changed. But all the same, this time I'm not going to run away. It's okay to feel weak sometimes. It's okay to be afraid. The important thing is that we face our fears. That's... that's what makes us strong.","1719":"But hating something you love is a painful feeling.","1720":"I've continually fought, and with each battle I've been killing my own heart. And my heart has been completely void of feeling for quite a long time now. Maybe my life doesn't have value anymore, but I have to keep on living.","1721":"We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails.","1722":"All adults are the same in the end. At first they are kind and sympathetic to make you drop your guard, then they try to kill you if you don't do as they say. That how adults always are. They're losers. The damn bastards!","1723":"A lie that can't be disproven is no different from the truth.","1724":"Do exactly as you like. That is the true meaning of pleasure. Pleasure leads to joy and joy leads to happiness. Your path is now clear, Kirei. So clear there is no longer any need to hesitate.","1725":"Children's minds are immature. They do not possess a firm resolve and the strength to turn their misery to anger. Confronted with a cruel fate, they were not provided with the choice of having a strong will. Moreover, as they have not lived through and comprehended life, ideals such as honor and hope are yet to be completely nurtured in them. Therefore, in moments of despair, children are more prone than adults to seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart. Because they have not tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard. Because they have not understood the meaning of future, they can sink into despair.","1726":"What?! Unbelievable! I picked the wrong Pok\u00e9mon!","1727":"Don't start thinking of killing just when the slightest thing doesn't go your way! How selfish are you!?","1728":"I am He, that arrogant fool who thought he could fool death itself with his money. Al Da Flaga, your father, but I am merely that man's defective clone.","1729":"Even if the world line changes, as long as you don't forget me, I'm there.","1730":"You'll always stand by the light. That is your basketball.","1731":"It doesn't matter what the essence of it is. The truth is what's hidden inside.","1732":"We all have the right to choose our own future. We should be able to walk the paths that we choose, not the future you\u00c2\u00b4ve decided for us.","1733":"The moment of one's confession, is the moment of another's dumping.","1734":"A grenade that's thrown should not come back.","1735":"Now, you\u2019ve only got two different options to choose from: Prove that everything I just said was bullshit, or admit your guilt.","1736":"No idiot would want to be friends with an unmoving, unspeaking telephone pole. However, unmoving and unspeaking is exactly what you'd want from a telephone pole.","1737":"I wonder why it is, that people fall in love with others? I think that to seek out love even when you already have a nice family is being greedy. No matter how much you like another person, you can never be with that person forever... But I dislike that. I don't care if I have to throw away everything else. I just want you to look at me.","1738":"But we're alive, aren't we? We don't have any magic power, but we're alive! We have the strength to overcome the weakness and the fear! That's what it means to be alive!","1739":"If I were to lose a friend...then I couldn't die in peace!","1740":"There is more than one way to win a game. You can win without fighting!","1741":"A choice isn't something someone gives you, it's something you make for yourself.","1742":"Don't ever think there's any perfect society made by humans!! If you think that way you'll overlook the enemy!! Don't be fooled by appearances!!","1743":"Human nature denies the past in order to justify the present. But do you believe there is anything in the present worth justifying?","1744":"I've already decided. Getting good grades and listening to teachers can take me somewhere high and far away, but what if that's not where I want to go? Right here, by your side, Tomoya, is the only place I want to be.","1745":"The world might seem boring. But, if you just look, you'll find all kinds of crazy stuff. The world is the best form of entertainment. Something like this couldn't just have happened by chance. There must be a writer writing the stories of more than five-billion people. And the only thing we could possibly call this person is God.","1746":"The fake is of far greater value. In its deliberate attempt to be real, it's more real than the real thing.","1747":"No amount of natural talent trumps hard work.","1748":"A life with no adventure in it is boring. The least a friend can do is stir up a little trouble in your heart.","1749":"Isn't changing yourself the same as running away? Why can't you just accept who you are?","1750":"If you aren't remembered, then you never existed.","1751":"If training hard can make you number one, then how many number one do you think this world will have!?","1752":"Often times, people simply deny the existence of what they do not understand, and anyone who tells them otherwise is a liar.","1753":"Please don't tell people our bakery's motorbike ran you over.","1754":"When you get anxious about the future, it is better not to think about it. The more you think about it the more anxious you'll get. Of course it's important to think about what lies ahead, too, but if you only look at what's down the road, you'll get tangled by the \"laundry\" by your feet and fall, won't you? You see, it's also important to think about what you can do now. What you can do today, and if you keep washing things one at a time, you'll be done before you know it. Sometimes the anxiety will start to well up, but when it does... take a little break. Read a book, watch tv, or eat soumen with everyone.","1755":"SHII-CHAN, YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!! (after learning that Shigure invited Akito to the summer house)","1756":"It doesn't hurt! It's not hot! I'm not scared! I will not be beaten!","1757":"Life isn't about what can and can not be done, it's about doing it or not doing it!","1758":"This world is still rotten!.. With too many rotten people.","1759":"You can run from your past all you want, but it will always follow you. Forever and ever and ever and ever.","1760":"A drama has a progressive thought, an emotional climax and a resolution, but our lives aren't like that. All we get day after day, are a bunch of vague anxieties that are never really resolved.","1761":"I must find a place to pawn this off.","1762":"If you hurt somebody or if someone hurts you, - the same red blood will be shed.","1763":"What you need are feelings and experiences. The feelings of the person seeking the rain must be in concert with those of the person making it.","1764":"Does my complexion look terrible to you? Does my face look pale to you? Do I look weak to you? Does it look like I haven\u2019t got long to live? Does it look like I\u2019m close to death?","1765":"This guy's a special kind of stupid.","1766":"I suppose having your name recorded in the history books is a form of immortality. But if that just means your name gets passed down for two thousand years and nothing else, I'd have preferred to have even a hundredth of that added to my actual life.","1767":"It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a tolerant person. I just don\u2019t want to think about these troublesome things.","1768":"There is a reason one wears make-up on stage. Applying color to one's face is almost a spell. When one's face is different, one's personality can change.","1769":"Sometimes you have to fight to get your point across.","1770":"I'm a pig, a louse, a useless cow! I destroyed Anubis! Such utter garbage cannot be allowed to live! I deserve to die!","1771":"It's not good to expect too much, but you can't do anything if you're being overly pessimistic. If you just wait thinking it's useless, nothing will come of it.","1772":"A writer once said that \"a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when he has nothing left to add, but when he has nothing left to take away\".","1773":"Space extends infinitely. The probability of an encounter may be low, but it isn't nonexistent.","1774":"I will do anything it takes to be the man she loves. I will survive this war. And when I return home, I will swallow every horrible thing I've done here, and I will smile when I'm with her. I swear on my life.","1775":"Don't succumb to panic. Only those who see the bigger picture win.","1776":"It's quite educational, seeing the thought process of someone in charge.","1777":"I wish I could go back to my childhood. It went by so quickly I feel like it was robbed from me.","1778":"Most people don\u2019t mind killing cows and chickens but they\u2019d probably have a hard time doing the same to chimpanzees. Partially, it\u2019s because chimpanzees bear a slight resemblance to humans, but the primary reason is that they can draw pictures. Suppose fish were able to draw pictures. Even if we are unable to understand what they\u2019re thinking, it becomes harder to kill animals that can draw. Instinctively, in our minds we would say to ourselves\u2026 \u201cMay be they have feelings\u201d That shows how high a value we assign to expression.","1779":"Assassination \u2014 It's the family trade. We all take it up. My folks see me as an exceptional prospect. But I don't see that I should have to live up to their expectations.","1780":"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.","1781":"You know, a lot of people make excuses when they lose.","1782":"In truth everyone gets their wings the day they are born, and if one has the courage to spread those wings, then he'll fly for sure","1783":"There are many kinds of fights in this world, but if you don't stick to the rules you won't win support from the people around you.","1784":"If it is with Ayuzawa, whatever I do, wherever I am, I am happy. So it's okay.","1785":"A cowardly thief would sneak away in the night; the King of Conquerors leaves with his loot amidst songs of victory!","1786":"I guess we won't be living together forever as gods. But still... This is forever, too.","1787":"[to Kenpachi Zaraki] I did not say that I hate you. What I mean to say is that you are unforgivable!!","1788":"If what I wished for was granted to me, if what I wanted was given to me. Then, as I thought, I wouldn't wish for anything nor want anything. Because the things you were granted and the things you were given were surely shams that would one day be lost. \n\nThe things you wished for had no shape and the things you wanted were untouchable. Or possibly, they might be the most wonderful treasures that would become nothing if you were to touch them.","1789":"That curse will spread throughout your whole body, bone and flesh alike and finally kill you. Now leave this place at sunrise. Return and *I* shall kill you.","1790":"I don't believe in god. There's no proof he exists. In a world where there isn't even proof of the future, the past exists. Even if it's tainted with misunderstandings and delusions, if the people themselves believe in it, the past is the truth to them. And, if you base your actions or your life around it, in a way, it's a type of god itself.","1791":"You should just steal the things you want.","1792":"CHILDBIRTH'S NOT ALCHEMY, YOU DOPE!","1793":"You sure say some funny things. Solitude? Does that only apply to me? Who isn't alone in this society? The time when our connection to others was the basis of our selves is long gone. In this world where everyone is watched over by the system and live within the system's standards, a community isn't necessary. Everyone just lives in their own cell, and the system tames them by giving them each their own personal serenity.","1794":"People don't vanish from this world the moment they die. Their true death is when they are forgotten by the living.","1795":"I will defeat him. It may cost my life to do it. However, if I survive, I'll make a promise. The same promise as that time, on the same thing as that time.","1796":"Real men know when to run like a little bitch.","1797":"Everyone has to die someday. But what they believed in will never fade away as long as someone protects it. Once you've resolved to take on those principles, no matter how much blood and tears you shed, you follow through with it! That's what it means to be a knight.","1798":"If you like, you can stay over here tonight. If you're lucky, you may see some cannibalism and that's always fun...","1799":"No one's going to give you a map. You've got to walk your own path.","1800":"To the me back then, you don\u2019t need to worry. You\u2019ll soon find something you can do, something you can set your heart on.","1801":"Even though you like someone already, your partner is decided for you... and you can't do anything about that crush. Because everyone keeps getting in the way... and saying you can't... But... when you're the one in love... the only thing that feels true... is that feeling.","1802":"It's strange isn't it. The two groups, which looked like they hated each other, are now shining the same color as they vanish into the distant sky.","1803":"A detective must become nothing more than an advocate. We must never put words to the feelings that failed to take form.","1804":"...Who decided a student can't win against a teacher?!","1805":"The closer you get to the sun, the darker your shadow will be.","1806":"Do you know the origin of the word \"utopia\"? The English philosopher, Thomas More, created this word with intense irony in mind. In Greek, it means \"A place that does not exist\".","1807":"They often say that stupid thoughts are no better than sleeping.","1808":"I see. So basically, you're a shinigami? And you came all the way from some place called Soul Society to vanquish evil spirits? Which means that monster earlier was one of those evil spirits? And it attacked that little girl? Okay, I belie- NO WAY I'LL BELIEVE THAT, DUMBASS!","1809":"Isn't that color a little bright for a ninja?","1810":"Okay, here's the plan: We go in, start hitting people, and see where it takes us.","1811":"So what if you're an aristocrat?! Dying for the sake of honor is something an idiot does!","1812":"Listen up, Cookie. Summer break is a break. We forget about homework. That's common sense. Understand?","1813":"\"No longer the Aizen you know,\" hm...? I'm afraid you've been deluded, Abarai-kun...The 'Aizen Sousuke' you knew never existed to begin with.","1814":"However happy or sad something is, you\u2019ll soon forget it if you don\u2019t get a chance to recall it. What people don\u2019t realize is that they\u2019ve forgotten about forgetting. If everyone really preserved the happiest memory from their past perfectly, they\u2019d only be sadder living in their relatively hollow present. And if everyone preserved the worst memory from their past perfectly, well, they\u2019d still be sad. Everyone just remembers what it\u2019s inconvenient not to remember.","1815":"Killing for your own ideas... even a bandit could do that if it's killing a complete stranger. However, it's a completely different thing when it comes to killing a relative or a friend. Desire alone isn't enough. You need indomitable will and unwavering beliefs.","1816":"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Even though each step is small, you never know if you'll end up achieving your major goal.","1817":"[about the inefficacy of his attack against Tsunade] Did it not penetrate deep enough because of her fat breasts?","1818":"At times, you will probably lose sight of your life goals, as well. When that happens, instead of panicking, why not try indulging in a hobby? Then a new, or perhaps an old, goal might grow stronger, and stronger, into a rousing fortissimo.","1819":"*to Ichigo* I thought you were interesting before, but now you're just a creepy kid.","1820":"When in doubt, don't worry about what's right. You'll run out of time. Don't use your head, you'll find the answer lower. Your heart knows what's right. Choose the answer that will be fun.","1821":"Weapons are used by soldiers on the battlefield. If you have never used them yourself, you have no idea what you're selling.","1822":"Fear is proof that your imagination is functioning. Frankly, I feel bad for anyone who can't feel fear. Without imagination, you can never deduce which action to take next.","1823":"I'll take fragments from the chaos of this world... and using the fountain of wisdom inside me, will reconstruct them into truth.","1824":"The future is not a straight line. There are many different pathways. We must try to decide that future for ourselves.","1825":"There's nothing unusual here\u2026 The appropriate one stands in the appropriate place after the inappropriate ones have collapsed to the ground, defeated. There is nothing unexpected or odd about it. Because this is reality. Not one shred of uncertainty exists here. Not even fear, of course\u2026","1826":"The worst part about being strong is that no one ever asks if you're ok.","1827":"Obeying a superior you can't even believe doesn't make you loyal. You're just fooling yourself.","1828":"Human beings are cruel. Even though it's heartbreaking, I feel hungry. Even though it's painful, I feel sleepy. And, even though it's painful for me, I still eat and sleep peacefully. I can't forgive myself, and hence it becomes even more painful.","1829":"Dying now, my breath will be erased, okay?","1830":"You let them take it from right under your nose.","1831":"The only thing waiting for you outside is a world of death.","1832":"Being good guys for once would be super-dupulous!","1833":"The easiest way to test a person's real ability is under extreme conditions. Therefore, it's appropriate to choose the Shaman King through fighting.","1834":"What do you think killed the most people in history? It wasn't explosives or drugs. It was information. To know is to die.","1835":"When someone gives you an inch, don\u2019t take a mile, you moron!","1836":"Oh, I'm sorry. Her head's so empty, so I mistook her for a vase and put flowers in her. You might want to spit that out quick, though. Those can be quite poisonous.","1837":"He appeared right in front of me, and he wasn't a demon... but what looked like a human. As if he'd been yanked from before into the present unchanged. I gazed at him and for a second... I forgot to kill him.","1838":"Upon researching the concept of demons, I believe that, among all life, humans are the closest thing to it.","1839":"What's wrong with wanting to keep the man you love out of harm's way?","1840":"You always seem to get in my way, Mu La Flaga. Though I imagine you'd say the same about me.","1841":"I'm tired if trying, sick of crying, I know I've been smiling, but inside I'm dying.","1842":"To enjoy an ordinary life, you must constantly evolve.","1843":"True, I've given up on the real world. However, I haven't given up on myself.","1844":"Could you stop skipping the thinking process when you respond?","1845":"How you change is up to you.","1846":"Humans are creatures that always get hurt and feel regret whenever they make a choice on something.","1847":"We don't know if trying our best will help, but we do know, that if we don't try our best, it won't help for sure!","1848":"Of course! Dogs embody loyalty, they follow their master's commands above all else! Be a jerk to them and they don't complain, and they never once beg for a paycheck! Trust me Fuery, they're the great servants of man! *singing* Loyal canine how we salute thee! *laughs maniacally*","1849":"Strength begins in understanding your own weakness.","1850":"If lives were lost today, then lives were also born. How important each day is... Depends on how important you feel it is to you.","1851":"Wear the best shoes you can, because those shoes will take you to great places.","1852":"What is there, over there? There is nothing. I was born in a bottom of a pit where no light shone. As if pressed together by the darkness. Untouched by everything at all. Born under those dark, dark sediments. I had a white form. My comrades were all in pure black. In those black forms with their eyes shining and teeth baring they were certainly eating something. And then... There was nothing to me, except my eyes. I felt nothing. No rather... It was possible that what I felt was \"void\", yet. I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to \"void\" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great \"void\". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose. If that isn't \"happiness\", then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist. There is nothing... in you... and... in me.","1853":"The weak don't get to decide anything, not even how they die.","1854":"I think you and I have different concepts of beauty. I was taught that it's beautiful to survive, unsightly or not.","1855":"The fight to protect life and the fight to protect honor\u2014\u2014that's Captain Ukitake's policy. But you know, Kuchiki...I think that in the end, those both end up being the same thing. ...Heart.","1856":"To believe in someone can be a dangerous thing.","1857":"When a man faces fear, his soul is tested. What he was born to seek... what he was born to achieve... his true nature will become clear.","1858":"I am lightning. No matter how hard they try, mankind can never overcome lightning. Since ancient times, mankind has labeled the unknowns of nature as God. And anything they could not understand, they feared. Everything which befalls mankind is said to be the work of God. Mankind accepts that it cannot defeat natural disasters. And I am one of them.","1859":"You don't have to try to get along with someone that you aren't interested in.","1860":"Humans love hurting others when they can\u00b4t be hurt themselves. Like killing animals, or flaming people online. And if the target makes a mistake, it fans the flames even more, and the bully gets even more fun out of it.","1861":"I knew it. You can't even ask your own zanpakut\u014d its name.","1862":"That's right...If I'm the first one here, I can save Kuchiki-san. Kurosaki must've wanted to rescue her himself...If I did it, he'd get really pissed...Heheheh...","1863":"Arrogance can plant a seed of sin. And loneliness can serve as its nursery.","1864":"It might be for the better if there are amusing people around me. Because any tragedy may seem a comedy, as long as I am with them.","1865":"If you can only do one thing, hone it to perfection. Hone it to the utmost limit.","1866":"I look like I'm suffering, huh? That's not good... But of course I'd be suffering. I mean, I'm gonna sail in uncharted waters, right? Both, taking on a challenge and creating something. It is painful, but it's fulfilling.","1867":"I don't understand what I say that makes people so mad. I don't understand how they feel. I know that's because I haven't properly socialized, I've tried to learn. I've tried to study up on it, but I just don't know what's right.","1868":"If you don't believe in anything, it no longer has the power to hurt.","1869":"Even if my left arm can transform into a monstrous claw and can destroy Akuma, im just a normal person with a promise...","1870":"In order to accomplish something, first you had to believe in yourself that you could do it.","1871":"You can't end a good party without someone on the floor.","1872":"Our world is like a terminal cancer. Saying you'll change things through individual will is rambling of a peace-loving fool.","1873":"After all, justice in this world is just a bunch of principles, made by those with power to suit themselves.","1874":"From this day on, I don't need freedom. As we struggle using our strength to grasp what's above us. We will eventually reach something, that is the meaning of the word freedom.","1875":"If you think about it, death really isn't so frightening. Who knows, you might actually enjoy it.","1876":"Any prize worth having requires a risk.","1877":"Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.","1878":"There are things you can't have no matter how much you want them. So it's easier to just forget them.","1879":"Was I not clear? Then lemme give you an example. Say that somewhere, there's this guy who's suffering the absolute worst fate in the world you could possibly think of. You get wind of this guy somehow and hearing what he's going through really upsets you. That would be meaningless sentimentality I'm talking about. This is a far-off, distant world we're talking about, one you shouldn't concern yourself with. So even if someone in this far-off world leads such a sad existence, it won't keep you from living every day with a smile on your face.","1880":"Hey... They say it's five centimeters per second. *Takaki asks her what she means by that* The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall... Five centimeters per second.","1881":"Fright is about the feeling that you will die. The true meaning of terror doesn't lie in a static condition, but in a change.","1882":"Do you know about the Happy Prince? It's such a happy story. The Prince helps everyone together with a little swallow, then he dies happily. But I wonder how the swallow felt? His wish wasn't granted because he helped the foolish Prince. Was the swallow really happy? It's always like that. The Prince and all the people he helped are happy, but what about the swallow? He helped the Prince more than anyone, so why is he ignored completely?","1883":"And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?","1884":"If you're going to give up that easily, we have no hope.","1885":"I'm still very very young. I want to go shopping, and I want to eats lots more of all kinds of yummy foods, you know? And of course... Of course... have a wonderful romance too. If I could have something like that, it would be the best. Yeah... That really would be the best.","1886":"Music isn't supposed to be something you do to show off your abilities to your rivals.","1887":"Throughout my life, the moments, and people who have defined me... they have all been illuminated by sparks.","1888":"It's not a matter of real or fake. These avatars are idols on the net. in other words - icons. Icons cannot solely exist through their own will. Neither Hayama nor Sugawara established their status on their own. They were able to become Talsiman and Spooky Boogie because their fans idolized them based on their own distorted perceptions. Their true feelings and colors are not the same as the ideals their characters represents. It's not surprising that a fan could do a better job than the real owners of playing the idol the fans expect to see.","1889":"You can't get hurt without also hurting others.","1890":"Finishing Strike! Black Star Big Wave!","1891":"When you compare love and hate in this world... There is a lot more hate than love, and it's much stronger. So, if we consider every one of them as hate, we'll be right most of the time. I don't have time to pick out the truth anyway.","1892":"No one knows what\u2019s going to happen to the world. But I believe we have the ability to deal with that. Although we cannot change the past - we can change the future. We can change it into the world we desire.","1893":"In this world, evil can arise from the best of intentions. And there is good which can come from evil intentions.","1894":"It seems I have overestimated you quite a bit. Your evolution did not even satisfy my expectations. This is the end.","1895":"Only humans, with their short lifespan, are driven to solve every problem they encounter. It is how they live.","1896":"If this world continues to reject me, then I shall reject the world.","1897":"The moment a person says he's working hard without thinking, he's still being naive. He is not trying at all!","1898":"It doesn't matter how good your armor is... if you can barely move!","1899":"Giraffe! Giraffe! I love Giraffes!","1900":"Phones, the internet - having the means alone doesn't lead to communication.","1901":"In the avatar state... You're at your most powerful, but you're also...at your most vulnerable. If you're killed in the avatar state, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the avatar will cease to exist.","1902":"People become themselves through their encounters. With different things, people, and emotions.","1903":"I don't understand the feelings of the weak. The law of the world is survival at its fittest. Its how the weak are weeded out. It just means those people that died were too weak. Its only natural for the weak to perish.","1904":"Kira is childish and he hates losing... I'm also childish and hate to lose. That's how I know.","1905":"Oh, silly me. I must have forgotten to turn on my hearing aid. When you're a washed up old hag like me, the memory is the first to go.","1906":"Trying to shoulder the burden all by yourself? Don't be a stranger. Weep and ask for help. Lean on me with your runny nose. Cry when you feel like crying. Laugh when you feel like laughing. When you're tearing up with an ugly face, I'll give you a good cry with an uglier face. When you're laughing so hard your stomach hurts, I'll laugh in a louder voice. That's how it should be. It's far better to get dirty while living true to yourself, than to throw away yourself and die a clean death.","1907":"So what if I'd spare him? In my mind it's the certainty in myself that I possess which allows me to have that kind of mercy or compassion. There's no wavering on that point. It's fixed like the stars. The fact is I'm never gonna be killed! So remember this: mercy and compassion are virtues that only the strong are privileged to possess. And I am strong.","1908":"If people had wings... They'd be monsters.","1909":"Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll only tire yourself out.","1910":"I've never seen a hero fall down stairs, cry, and get first aid from demons.","1911":"Your back is your one big blind spot.","1912":"You cannot understand that which you do not know, and that misunderstanding breeds hatred.","1913":"Okay. I will protect all of you. I will never let another friend die.","1914":"She should want to see me. If I had said how I feel about her, she would miss me even more. All this time, I've been breaking her heart by keeping her wait, yet I can't still appear before her eyes. I never want to see her cry anymore. Even if it means I no longer exist in her heart. How immature of me, right?","1915":"Even if you have your reasons and there are things you can't tell me, no matter what, I'm on your side.","1916":"It's truly infuriating... I despise people like you who put their own lives in jeopardy for some glorious, hopeless cause.","1917":"Maybe, just maybe, it's a concept that's similar to a zero in mathematics. In other words, it's a symbol that denies the absence of meaning, the meaning that's necessitated by the delineation of one system from another. In analog, that's God. In digital, that's zero.","1918":"Stand up! lift your faces! Take up your weapons! Look at that boy. He's so weak and fragile a breath could blow him away and he's unarmed! He is a powerless boy, whose defeat I have seen with my own eyes! He's weaker than anyone else here! Yet he's shouting louder than anyone that we can still do this so how can we sit down, with downcast gaze? If our weakest man has not given up how is kneeling in defeat acceptable for us? Did you come this far to wallow in shame?","1919":"I thought growing older would turn me into an adult. I believed I'd find work, get married, and become an adult. But none of those things have happened. Even though I've grown older, I feel like nothing's changed.","1920":"Saying humans can't be trusted, please never use such words again!","1921":"Flowers are fragile and ephemeral... Even if you meant to protect them with a surrounding fence from wind and rain, they would die without sunlight...and a spindly fence has no power against a strong wind. Are you fully aware of that, Kudo-kun?..","1922":"Explosion!!!","1923":"Those who rely on \"someday\" will only grow weaker and lowlier.","1924":"You stole this world and it's people. You're a king of thieves, alone upon a stolen throne!","1925":"We are the sum of our memories.

I thought your drive to protect allowed you to take advantage of your capabilities\u2026 this may have been a reason, but not I too have this drive. I fought to do as I wished, because it was fun to kill my enemies and feed my pride. But he\u2019s different, he fights not to win but because he absolutely won\u2019t lose, causing him to break his limits and he really doesn\u2019t care who his opponent is. So when he didn\u2019t kill me, it was because he saw I could care for others, like I do now\u2026 Go Kakarot, you\u2019re number one!","1958":"I don't want to be a loser who can't do anything but talk. I don't want to be somebody who can sacrifice others, but won't risk himself.","1959":"There aren't many things you can believe. That's how human beings work.

Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it: there's no one, but I can do it.

By doing so, even if you did get hurt a little bit, it wouldn\u2019t end up being a lasting wound.","2008":"Because of our broken instincts, we are in pain. We continue living in pain, because our instincts have been twisted by reason. So, what are we supposed to do? Should we abandon knowledge? Throw away reason? In any event, that wouldn't be possible. For better or for worse, we ate the fruit of knowledge long, long ago.","2009":"I was curious. Mikuni-san and Tsuyuki-senpai are the same. You say you'll \"destroy\" vampires. You never say \"kill\". Senpai. You've never seen a vampire playing games while lazing around the house, have you? A vampire crying that they're \"sorry for lying\" and regretting... A really bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met too! I've seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They're all my comrades. You know, it'd be good if you just talked about what's bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons to want to protect or save something. If they find C3 is weakening, the balance between humans and non-humans will collapse. If we suffer major damage from Tsubaki's side and asked you all for help, can you guarantee that none of the other vampires would attack C3? I don't really know... what the situation between vampires and C3 is, but, simply put, we need to protect it all, so that nobody gets hurt!","2010":"I yearn for you more than anyone else.

Which is...to die alone.","2013":"When you lose something, you gotta find something to take its place. I guess it's just time... for me to move forward for once.","2014":"I've never talked to a girl before. I don't know how to handle it.","2015":"We'll worry about the future once we get there.","2016":"Trunks, I never hugged you as a baby\u2026 let me hug you.","2017":"It's not that you can fall in love with someone new because you forgot the old. It's because you fall in love with someone new, that you're able to forget about the old. Only love can heal a heart that was hurt by love.","2018":"In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony Shinobi's blessing. But because, I'm enlightened by my intelligence.","2019":"The days I spent with you were a lot of fun. I realized for the first time that it makes me so happy to be needed by others. I thought I'd get along well with you like this. But I can't. I was being a jerk. While I was with you, I was looking at someone else. I kept it to myself even after realizing that. I was taking advantage of your kindness.","2020":"I'm as normal as they come and this is a contest of freaks! What do you want me to do, shoot my slingshot at him?","2021":"And the one person who I thought understood me was just using me all along. No one ever treated me as an equal. Adults are all trash. They didn't listen when I said that it hurt. They didn't listen when I told them to stop. They didn't listen to anything I said!","2022":"If you have faith, your dreams will surely come true.","2023":"I don't think anyone is born knowing the reason why they're here. It's just something you have to find as you go along.","2024":"No matter how hard someone's heart is, if you keep on talking to them, little by little, it'll eventually start to crack! I believe it! I believe that useless effort doesn't exist in this world!","2025":"If the drive behind one's actions is the thought for another, then it is never meaningless.","2026":"Sometimes, I just think... this world has surpassed its capacity. It's overflowing. Our day-to-day lives are replete with both happiness and misfortune. Yet, because we cannot see the excess from the inside, we still feel unfulfilled. Given that we are capable of acknowledging neither excess nor deprivation, we might as well not exist. In other words... you can't withdraw coins from an ATM. That's common sense.","2027":"I have no fear of death. It just means dreaming in silence. A dream that lasts for eternity","2028":"Revenge is a rite that restores one\u2019s spirit after it has been ravaged by the anger and hatred of loss. That is the only way to heal one's soul and stand up again to face reality. That is the only way we can have a tomorrow.","2029":"Lives are never of equal value. There is always a ranking order.","2030":"Don\u2019t use such strong words. It'll only make you look weak.","2031":"You may not always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you keep moving, you will come to a better place.","2032":"People derive their happiness in a variety of ways, even though it might seem cruel.","2033":"When you are experienced you can become overly confident and such confidence can prove fatal.","2034":"People in supervising positions in investigation are supposed to give too much of their opinion, and if they are wrong, all it would take is an apology.","2035":"Don\u2019t you know the saying \u2018Man proposes; God disposes\u2019 ? First, you do your best and then fate will decide how it will turn out.","2036":"You can run away, but that'll just make it worse!","2037":"One shot is for all you did to everyone here... And all the rest are because you messed up my clothing.","2038":"If I could sell boredom, I would make a fortune out of it.","2039":"Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.","2040":"You're stubborn and reckless, all you like to do for fun is read, so you're boring, and you have fat ankles.","2041":"I don't care how pathetic or embarassing I look in front of everyone. My love for him...only that...is my bitter sweet treasure.","2042":"(singing) Leaves from the vine\nFalling so slow\nLike fragile tiny shells\nDrifting in the foam.\nLittle soldier boy\nCome marching homeBrave soldier boy\nComes marching home...","2043":"Maybe humans are capable of committing far more shameless acts than they imagine they are. If they hadn\u2019t faced adversity, they might have gone without discovering such ugly facets of themselves.","2044":"There's no way someone who can't even protect himself can protect anyone else, is there?","2045":"Of what worth is a king who fails to protect the powerless?","2046":"We might be scared but that's what makes us stronger!","2047":"What\u2019s wrong Frieza? Is your brain another one of your weak and under used muscles?","2048":"The purpose of an alliance is not simply for the sake of preventing an enemy from attacking you. Rather, importance lies in what one can obtain after the alliance. As well as your actions after the alliance.","2049":"It\u2019s unbearable to die hating someone.","2050":"Sometimes I think the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house.","2051":"Everyone has their own reasons to fight! Sometimes, you have to settle it yourself or there's no way forward!","2052":"A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead! Saber, you said you would become a martyr for your ideals. In life, you must have been a pure saint. A proud and noble figure, certainly. But who can truly admire the martyr's thorny path? Who dreams of such an ending?\n\nA king... The king must be greedier than any other. He must laugh louder and rage harder. He must exemplify the extreme of all things, good and evil. That is why his retainers envy and adore him. And why the flames of aspiration, to be as the king is, can burn within his people. \n\nProud king of chivalry... The righteousness and ideals you bore may indeed have saved your nation once. However, I'm certain you know what became of those who were saved, but left to themselves.\n\nYou saved them, but you never led them. You never showed them what a king should be. You abandoned your men when they lost their way. Then, alone and untroubled, you followed your own petty little ideals.\n\nThus, you are no true king. You are only a little girl, enraptured by a false idol of the king who serves others, but not themselves.","2053":"Even if you hate it or whatever, I'll never let go of you. If you run away, I'll probably come after you and lock you up.","2054":"Stars. Don't. Clean.","2055":"It doesn't do any good to pretend you can't see what's going on.","2056":"It's not just allies who support each other. From your enemies, you learn so much and gain so much. Until the day you meet again... Just knowing they exist helps you to withstand the loneliness. Those who compete, even if they're enemies, help each other out.","2057":"Why are you punching? What are you chasing? You should already know the answer to that. To become strong.","2058":"They say the tongue is the root of all misfortune.","2059":"Her sword shines, a dream that all warriors  scattered in battle, past, present, and future, hold and mournfully exalt as their final moments approach. She carries their will as her pride, bidding them to remain steadfast in their loyalty.","2060":"That's all I wanted to say. There is nothing at the end of helping people. It is a false life that can save neither yourself nor others.","2061":"To live is to undertake a journey - no, to undertake a journey is to live. To face the wind or to follow it, all journeys lead to the gates of death... The light in which all journeys are taken is deceptive - not hopeful, but sorrowful. And the struggle never ends. Everywhere on the earth is fleeting life. We are blown by the wind. The words we write in the sand disappear and finally, when we are swallowed by the sea we do not hear the waves. The humblest of creatures must face these dreadful barriers. No-not barriers, but challenges rather...","2062":"If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate.","2063":"Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?","2064":"Sun, it's just a mass of hydrogen... Get too close to it and all you do is burn.","2065":"The truth can be concealed by the position one chooses to take,but can also be revealed once more.","2066":"Dad left... A long time ago, when brother and I were still boys. Mom stared off into the distance a lot. But she carried on as if nothing were wrong.","2067":"And, Araragi-kun....I love you.","2068":"Wiping out any and all injuries as if they never happened. A spell like that... Do you really believe he can cast it without paying any price? In order to rewind the Eidos changelog and make a full copy,the stored information must be read in its entirely. Needless to say, that includes the pain and suffering experienced by the injured party. Not only that, but it's transmitted instantaneously in condensed form. For example, from the time that Isori was injured until brother cast his spell, roughly 30 seconds had gone by. Whereas the time Brother spent reading the Eidos changelog... was approximately 0.2 seconds. In that blink of an eye, my Brother's mind felt 150 times the pain and suffering experienced by Isori, condensed. Everytime Brother heals someone's wounds, that is the price he pays. Do you really mean to say that he should still use that power for others?","2069":"It's a programmer's job to make the most of limited resources to turn an impractical idea into reality.","2070":"Being alone is better than being with the wrong person.","2071":"All this time, I seriously thought that it's better to die than to live your life alone.","2072":"Being a detective isn't about bringing someone down, but rather protecting someone.","2073":"A bond may seem like a beautiful thing from the outside...but if those involved see it as a burden, it's nothing but a shackle.","2074":"Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.","2075":"Nine-Tails, you are merely a momentary life, a temporary existence of coalesced energy... energy that once was a single, ultimate form! An unstable force, lacking in intelligence or sapience, you require a guide to show you purpose. That guide is the Uchiha! The tailed beasts are but slaves to those with blessed eyes. Obey!","2076":"Instead of sighing about the past, I'd rather be happy to face the present.","2077":"These days, I feel more comfortable in dark places.  I look at these shadows as a part of you.  They absorb all the light.  There's no one in the world who has this color but you.","2078":"Everyone's fighting for their own kind of freedom. It seems small; but in their hearts, nothing is more important. With such hopes, I won't have enough time for revenge or fear, right?","2079":"I don't need some ring or some throne! If it means that I won't lose you... I would throw everything away!","2080":"The fastest way to happiness is to avoid looking at reality.","2081":"Being able to work hard is the best talent of all.","2082":"Being happy is not a right, but a duty. A duty to yourself. Waiving rights is one thing, but failing in your duty is downright irresponsible.","2083":"A true hero is a sage with a clean heart, a fake hero is a fool with an ignoble heart. The sage will be saved and the fool will be punished.","2084":"Thanks for such a boring time, it was a blast!","2085":"Because it has powers that surpass everything, a king must cut off his own desires and never use it.","2086":"What takes reason a hundred years to build a bridge to only takes the wings of faith a single night to reach.","2087":"The bells are very loud today.","2088":"There were many tears, many unsure times, and many troubled moments. The fun memories were only a few, but even so, those memories will shine bright like stardust and continue to shine on in my heart.","2089":"You\u2019d better not (rip my mask). Like Pandora\u2019s box, you want to open it because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside.

The world has been destroyed and we've fallen countless times, always resurrecting from the ashes as Paradise. It has happened before, and it will happen again. An endless cycle of life and death. The world is a Paradise that was opened by someone, but this era too is almost at an end. We have acquired the means to exceed our natural span of life, never suspecting that the world itself was finalized in its existence. This knowledge has left me in despair, my fate has fallen and scattered like the petals of a dying flower, like the blast from a sand storm it has been worn down and weathered away. As if to be purified, the world will be encased in ice so that it can return to the beginning once more. Paradise is a world that is opened by someone...","2091":"That\u2019s just the way it is. Change is inevitable. Instead of resisting it, you\u2019re better served simple going with the flow.","2092":"Humans are weak... but we want to live. Even if we're wounded... or tortured... we feel the pain.","2093":"Every individual must be aware of themselves. If not, those who watch them think fools of themselves.","2094":"It's Me with a capital M! I'm the only one big enough to capitalize Me!","2095":"There is a word \"world\".

When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! It\u2019s when... they are forgotten.","2099":"It's impossible to share everything. No one can become someone else. It's natural to envy someone who's more wealthy or who has higher standing. That's how conflicts begin. However, being blissfully unaware of this, relying on whatever someone provided without thinking, and only seeing things as \"black\" or \"white\" with such overly simplified thinking... Isn't that a sin as well? People need to think for themselves. For this reason, someone \"grey\", someone between \"black\" and \"white\" is essential. I will not gloss over the flaws in my ideals. It's not possible for all of mankind to share the same kind of thoughts. However, everyone is capable of thought. Everyone can learn, share, and decide with their own strength. A world built upon an understanding of that. If this is a \"dream\", if I don't realize it, who will?","2100":"I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Takashi! I won't forget to brush my teeth again! I won't forget!...","2101":"I am not going to kill you - I am going to break you.","2102":"The weak have no rights or choices.

And you\u2019re going to enjoy it.","2109":"I shall now express my utter disgust and anger with you through the piano.","2110":"Heaven is a six-tatami, one room, second floor apartment on Earth. Being a NEET is the best.","2111":"That's right... This world... is cruel. It hit me that living was like a miracle.","2112":"I wish I could rewrite my past.. but I can't. If I could, I'd do all I could if it would stop you from crying. But.. that's impossible. My past won't change. That's why we need to make my past pale in comparison to our present.","2113":"(referring to his father) There are three lessons he taught me when I was six. Lesson one: Protect yourself, by yourself. Parents can't protect you forever. Work out or think hard and figure out a way to take care of things by yourself. Don't get close to things you can't take care of. Use your imagination to avoid danger. Lesson two: There's more than one answer. Things can be resolved in many ways. On the contrary, there's no answer in some cases. Don't get hung up with one way. And finally, lesson 3: Don't think your parents are always right.","2114":"Yeah Kid you're not garbage. If you were garbage you would smell a lot worse so why don't we just get up and try again okay?","2115":"As it turns out, living was a punishment.","2116":"Well, I don't think we can deny the distinct possibility that the world we are in now was freshly created, by Her, last night! In any case, it's an honor to meet you and Miss Suzumiya again. *laughing softly* Be seeing you after class!","2117":"Even if I force myself to smile. It seems I'm the type of person who ends up being hated.","2118":"I dunno, getting rid of stuff that doesn't even exist... it's basically just counselling, isn't it?","2119":"If you have memories no one else remembers, what's the point in remembering them?","2120":"BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! MY BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!","2121":"Right now, I'm letting you live. And I'll continue to keep you alive... until you've grown enough to become worth killing.","2122":"You can steal the very last bite of my very best food. You can mock me all you want. But if you insult my best friend, I will obliterate you.","2123":"We can't let the past be mere water under the bridge. Even so, there's no reason that we can't come together.","2124":"Rock, if you think about it, other than this, what do we really value in life? God? Love? Don't make me laugh. When I was a brat, crawling around in that shithole city, it seemed God and Love were always sold out when I went looking. Before I knew better, I clung to God and prayed to Him every single night \u2014 yeah, I believed in God right up until that night the cops beat the hell out of me for no reason at all. All they saw when they looked at me was another little ghetto rat. With no power and no God, what's left for a poor little Chinese bitch to rely on? It's money, of course, and guns. Fuckin' A. With these two things, the world's a great place.","2125":"Ah, my most ugly heart. I hate, hate, hate it, so I can\u2019t help but sneer all the time.","2126":"To have the one you think is your ideal self standing in front of you, it's tough...","2127":"This punch is heavier than life itself!","2128":"The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right next to them and know you can never have them.","2129":"Can you do me a favor? Could you kill me with your fangs? Can you still not forgive me? Am I still a traitor?","2130":"The stronger a person looks, the weaker he is.","2131":"Regardless of our limitations, we can always be of some use. Our power may seem insignificant... but it may just prove to be useful in the grand scheme of things. Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world. Which is why everyone must stay alert and ready to strike at any moment!","2132":"The moment you find the courage to give up your life for someone... Would be the moment you understand love.","2133":"When you want to scream or cry, I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll share your feelings and stay with you.","2134":"If people could become friends simply by sharing bread and salt, life would be simpler.","2135":"I think the best disciplining is pain.","2136":"What does a view from a high place remind you of? The impulse you feel when you look down at the world you live in. A violent cognition that attacks you even if you refuse it. An emotion created by an overlooking view - That's \"far\". The scenery you see from a high place is magnificent. Even an ordinary landscape looks beautiful. But a vision that's too large creates a boundary between you and the world. It's more correct for you to recognize the large world you see as the world you live in rather than as the small space around you. But you can't feel that you're living in this big world no matter how hard you try.Your reasoning, represented by your knowledge, and your experience, respresented by your realization, will crash against each other. And eventually, you will lose yourself and confusion will begin. And then you will fall. Vision is not what your eyes see, but an image that your brain comprehends. Our vision is protected by our common sense. Humans cannot live outside their box... under normal circumstances.","2137":"My heart was beating so fast, that one heart wasn't enough.","2138":"People get corrupted. Not even saints and heroes are safe. There's nothing you can do to prevent it.

Cut me down if you want.","2141":"Once you have a power, sometimes you are put into a situation which make you carry extra burdens, and live all your life with pain.","2142":"Weak humans are sly and irresponsible, they always put the blame on and hurt others.","2143":"You won't know if you don't give it a try.","2144":"Now, dear Uncle, there's a certain person that I'd just love to kill. It doesn't even matter whether they're weak or strong. The people I live to kill, that really get me jazzed... never see it coming. Never. They're in some happy place where they're sure nothing can get them. Dying is the furthest thing from their minds. Maybe they're thinkin' about what they're gonna have for dinner. Just like you were. Right before I walked in.","2145":"\"Time\" is proof that people have lived. Every person lives the time that has been given to them... that is life.","2146":"It's okay not to feel \"whole\". Even if you feel only partly complete, if you repeat that enough, it'll eventually be \"whole\". A part... is better than zero.","2147":"If we have time to get upset, we should have used that time to move on\u2026 Even if just one step forward!","2148":"Suppose someone said \"humans are foolish\"... Obviously, that person would be talking about themselves as well. If you want to understand human beings, you need to do more than just watch them. You need to pay attention to what they themselves are watching. What are you watching? You are the ones who I'm watching. It may be hard to believe, but I like you guys. You know what they say... The opposite of love is not hatred, but indifference. An indifferent person would lack the drive to kill or hurt. My mind keeps jumping around. Am I nervous...? Did I underestimate my enemy so much that I stepped in too deep...? ...What a silly thought.","2149":"Prodigies don't understand how the incompetent feel.","2150":"We aren't flying away from everyone to leave them, but rather so we might see them again someday.","2151":"Starting today... I'll be with you! I'll always be by your side! (to a young Kyo)","2152":"Normally I hate people who whine all the time, but in your case... it would be okay to complain, be selfish and say what you want once in a while. It's okay to let yourself be sad.","2153":"In the end, aren't they just a bunch of weaklings?","2154":"It's as if you are stuck in some predetermined program, following some predetermined script. If you really want to live in reality, then fight against it. Break through destiny with your own hands, and build your own reality!","2155":"I have no idea what you really want, what you're really thinking, or what the right thing to do really is. But I'm your friend. Let me stay.","2156":"It's still a form of love. To those with the emotion of love, acts of rebelling, anger, cursing, fighting, and killing do not work in contradiction to that emotion. Rather, too strong a love could quicken them. What the other wishes is not all there is to love.","2157":"A real man is someone who forgives a woman for her lies!","2158":"The true power of us human beings is that we can change ourselves on our own.","2159":"Sometimes I think delinquents are people\u2026 Who still have hope that things still can get better if they just put up a SOS sign. But I don\u2019t even have the will to lift that sign anymore.","2160":"No matter how hard you blow, you can never extinguish our fire. As long as a single flare remains, the others can be relit.","2161":"If today is the worst day ever - tomorrow has to be better.","2162":"Listen, even if someone is suffering before you, the kind of person that can take up arms without hesitation to shoot down the villain is no better than a villain himself. The kind that doesn\u2019t care about others, doesn\u2019t give 2nd chances; someone that kills if given a reason, is definitely not a hero. You don\u2019t have to become that kind of person. That\u2019s my specialty. Only I have to go through that.","2163":"You don't stand a single chance to win, unless you fight.","2164":"If you don\u2019t give up, you\u2019ll get through.","2165":"Of course, if you lose in fighting it'd be a problem, but it's also a problem if you lose in character","2166":"Hundreds of gallons of blood from all the people I've killed in the past, have seeped into this body.","2167":"False tears bring pain to those around you. A false smile brings pain to one self.","2168":"Now that I think about it, I really didn't understand anything back then. Neither what it meant to pray for a miracle...nor the price of one.","2169":"Do you have any idea how stupid we are? Don't underestimate us!!!","2170":"Awww maaan, and I really didn't feel like using it this early either. Better watch closely, and make sure you don't tell a soul! Bankai!!","2171":"I am the Dark Flame Master. Perish, enveloped in the flames of darkness!","2172":"Are flaws really bad? Because they are not perfect, they become worried. They don't stand still and instead move forward. After they become perfect, they will stand still. Incompleteness is the ideal.","2173":"Betrayal demands revenge. Sin must have punishment.","2174":"God, just how long are they going to squabble over such pointless things? They are all the same in my eyes. Nothing but a bunch of trash. Light and Darkness. Good and Evil. Poison and Antidote. Winning and Losing. Strength and Weakness. Black and White. Success and Failure. Happiness or Sorrow... They're all the same after all. Why hasn't everyone realized this already...","2175":"If it's this world behind the eyelids, anybody can become the person I imagine them to be.","2176":"If you bottle up your sadness too much, you'll forget what's really important.","2177":"I will show you my own move.","2178":"Grown-ups are idiots. If they really want to bring an end to this endless fighting, they need to sit down with one another and reach a truce.","2179":"As long as it's for the right cause, there's nothing wrong with playing dirty.","2180":"The time is almost here. Go and lay the groundwork. A world where only true pirates can survive will soon be upon us. Those without power, flee while you can. The tide will bring those of unmatched power and the New Era will begin!","2181":"Inside my memories lies sad thoughts and it's hard to forget, but I try everyday to keep moving forward in life, so why can't you, living in saddness isn't living at all.","2182":"They say that ill weeds grow apace, but... You know, the nice ones don't live long.","2183":"We all have our scars from loving someone too deeply, from wanting to protect  someone too much.","2184":"I know you play by higher standards, but at least give me credit for the nose.","2185":"You're lucky Al. Since your body's huge.","2186":"[thinking] I only take family as patients and I still get worked to death.","2187":"Those who have no skill, require harsh instruction if they are to have any hope to get any better.","2188":"I think I was born with special strength for the purpose of defeating Muzan Kibutsuji. But I was lacking. In the end, I failed. Because of that, many more people will die from now on\u2026 and that pains me.","2189":"Don't just think about the ones you have lost. You can't get back what you have lost. What is it that you still have ?","2190":"You\u2019re too kind. Remember this and take it to heart: kindness sometimes leads to even greater tragedy.","2191":"Accomplishing a shared goal under tense circumstances causes distance between people to naturally close.","2192":"The difference between your decision and ours is experience. But you don't have to rely on that. CHOOSE... Believe in yourself, or believe in the survey corps and me. I don't know... I never have. I can believe in my own abilities or the choices of the companions I trust. But no one ever knows how it will turn out. So choose for yourself, whichever decision you will regret the least.","2193":"Yes, I have no reason to take part in the Absurd and Unreasonable real world.","2194":"If you just submit yourself to fate, then that's the end of it.","2195":"Why do I want to win so much...? Everyone takes up soccer for different reasons. But we all have a passion for the sport... That drive carries us through a game, even if we lose. If we win, it pushes us forward to the next game. The winners of the game honour the losers by playing with everything they have... and until we hit a wall, until a better team beats us, we should try our best, instead of running away. That's what I want to do!","2196":"Even if a fool dies, he won't be cured.","2197":"The world is beautiful. Even if you're full of tears and sadness, open your eyes. Do what you want to do. Be what you want to be. Find friends. Don't be in a hurry to grow up. Take your time.","2198":"Even when our eyes are closed, there's a whole world out there that lives outside ourselves and our dreams.","2199":"Regardless of whether your friends believe, you still care for them, correct? Isn't that why you feel so sad?","2200":"Everything eventually faces destruction. Everything eventually disappears.","2201":"You can't achieve anything if you don't make a move. Love is an all-out assault.","2202":"So, you don't like to get hit, huh? Well, you're about to have a very bad day.","2203":"All I ever did was pay attention to myself. And I'm not even sure I saw myself clearly.","2204":"That's not exactly right. If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you're more likely to give up and throw it away. Including relationships you have in your hand now.","2205":"[To Hinata At Chuunin Exams] So you're not going to withdraw? Then don't blame me for what happens to you.","2206":"[thinking] Step awaaaay from the psycho...","2207":"All meetings must end with partings.","2208":"When you meet your God tell him to leave me alone.","2209":"You're like a cat. If I get close, you'll ignore me and go far away. If I get hurt, you'll play around to share the pain.","2210":"The more inexperienced you are, the more you want to show off.","2211":"Nothing good ever comes from a man interfering with women's problems.","2212":"Well, who you love depends on the person. Isn't everything fine as long as it's someone who's fun to be with? Being with someone doesn't require any permission as long as the two people accept each other. If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose. Don't forget that. You can't go out with someone with incomplete feelings.","2213":"*points at Black Star* What is that? Some kind of monkey? Yeah...it must be a monkey.","2214":"*to Shinpachi* Was your sister raised by gorillas?","2215":"There are plenty of guys who are good at fighting, but there aren\u2019t many guys like you, Takemichi.","2216":"Nature itself is absurd. Humans are the only ones who whine about it.","2217":"Humans tend to think logically, but their actions are driven by emotions...","2218":"Take it, that courage you have locked in your heart. Awaken it, wipe your tears, be strong and use that courage.","2219":"Feelings of romantic love are, in the end, just some chemical reaction. Under the right conditions, they occur no matter who the other person is.","2220":"Living things are restrained by Chains: The laws of nature, the flow of time, the vessel known as your \u201cbody\u201d, and the existence called your mind. There's only one chain that people can wield: WORDS.","2221":"DEATH is so unfair. It comes to those who don't need it. But not the people who are asking for it.","2222":"I hate people with a big heart. All they do is look down on you from above. They don\u2019t give a damn about the petty struggles of the people serving under them. If that\u2019s what it means to be a king, then that\u2019s just sad and pathetic.","2223":"A man who praises a man to his face is full of ulterior motives.","2224":"People cry, not because they're weak. Its because they've been strong for too long.","2225":"Calling me a coward, eh? At least say it so I can hear it...","2226":"Being angry consumes energy and makes me tired. So I'd rather apologize, even if I'm not at fault. Besides, we get along, and we both want to stay friends. Prolonging an awkward situation out of stubbornness is just silly.","2227":"It is pointless to question who someone really is. All you can do is believe and accept. Because the way you perceive someone is their true identity.","2228":"Can anyone hear me? I'm the first man in space. If you look up, well, maybe you'll see it. Or at least please listen. We've left the oceans and climbed above the mountains. I'm flying. We've found the untouched realm of God. You have to look now, it's your only chance. Nothing is here yet, not even air or water to ruin. Soon the next man will follow to touch it, and another, and in all the rush, we may again destroy it. Maybe our killing comes from the madness of being confined. Please listen, there's no more reason to kill because we don't have any more borders now! Can anyone hear me? If you can hear me, then pray. The humblest of all things, the most noble \u2013 pray for each step you take. Make a path that is safe so that those who follow you will never stumble. Dear God, please give us your mercy - mercy for we are lost. Forgive the irresponsible, the trivial men who beg you from the dark for the forgiveness of your light.","2229":"I'm going to teach you how to talk to your seniors, baldy.","2230":"When I was at the brink of life and death, I used all of my will to survive. I drew upon a different power than that of self-sacrifice and mastered an ultimate technique. The will to live is stronger than anything else. That was the ray of light that my master risked his life to show me. As Hitokiri Battousai, I have committed so many crimes that I cannot possibly repent for them. That is why I had secretly believed that it didn't matter when I died or was killed. However, now... even if I am formally punished or restrained. I will never lose the will to live.","2231":"Yes, we have no destiny. Only those swallowed up by ignorance and fear who take false steps, shall plunge us into the waters called \u201cdestiny\u201d.","2232":"It feels like time is passing so quickly. Damn you, Einstein!

But it\u2019s just so tragic too.","2233":"We shouldn't blame ourselves for bad things that happened to us. Sometimes, no matter what we do, we are victims of the circumstances. We should just have to pull ourselves out.","2234":"Whatever your thoughts may be, if you don't say them, none of it will be acknowledged by others.","2235":"Even though I'm expressionless, being told that I'm annoying still hurts.","2236":"The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it.","2237":"People are like dice, a certain Frenchman said that. You throw yourself in the direction of your own choosing. People are free because they can do that. Everyone's circumstances are different, but no matter how small the choice, at the very least, you can throw yourself. It's not chance or fate. It's the choice you made.","2238":"If I have to hurt someone, if I have to injure a comrade, then I might as well hurt myself.","2239":"Nothing in this world is free. Be thankful to those who speak strict word to you. Watch out for a person who talks too nicely.","2240":"We cannot be satisfied until we have eliminated all others. It has nothing to do with reason.

But, when she stays by my side and smiles with me, I feel like I can do anything.","2245":"Words are like swords. If you use them the wrong way, they can turn into ugly weapons.","2246":"Why do I always do this? I fall in love with someone, then I get all these and then I feel brokenhearted. And It's always my fault.","2247":"Nezuko is a human ever since the time she was born.","2248":"The chains of fear are easily broken with the blade of courage.","2249":"Laws aren't perfect, because humans who created laws aren't perfect. It's impossible to be perfect. However, the laws are evidence of the human's struggle to be righteous.","2250":"Suppose that you were sitting down at a table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.","2251":"I cried alone every single night.

Survive and Kill the one who couldn't kill YOU!","2277":"Stop pitying yourself. Pity yourself, and life becomes an endless nightmare.","2278":"The important things in life, like feelings, hearts, and souls, are all things you can never see.

But made not a single mention of \"The world I love\".","2283":"I hate the word \"fate.\" Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that's all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel. Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn't amount to anything...","2284":"There is no such thing as a perfect person. That is why we cannot live alone.","2285":"I was only able to get back to being a real doctor by saving your life! I realized that human lives have equal value by saving you! Nobody has the right to take another's life! I've been living as a doctor with that engraved upon my heart for years!","2286":"What would you have me say? \"Don't worry, I'm sure he's still alive.\"? Ridiculous. I am not here to comfort you. I don't understand why are you so fixated on life and death? At any rate, your friends will soon be annihilated. So what if that's one step closer? They should have seen this coming from the start. If they couldn't see it coming, the fault lies in their own foolishness. Laughing them off as a group of idiots would be sufficient. Why can't you do that? If it were me, and my friends entered Hueco Mundo without first gauging their strength, I'd be infuriated by their stupidity.","2287":"The first one to panic is the first one to lose. No matter if they're the hunter or the hunted.","2288":"Humans who lose the capacity to think become creatures who's existence has no value. Think, you humans who are split into two worlds, unless you want the gulf between humans to expand into oblivion, you must think!","2289":"There is only one person who you can each truly love. It\u2019s too bad that you can\u2019t change who that person is. If you could, the you both would be a lot happier.","2290":"People do not exist to follow rules. Rules exist to protect the people.","2291":"Everyone loses sight of themselves sometimes. Don't worry about it.","2292":"A normal person looks away from what they don't want to see even though they know there are things they can only acquire if they face the things they hate.","2293":"My problem is probably that I don\u2019t have any confidence about anything I do. Even if the thing I want most is right in front of me, I can\u2019t help but imagine a future where I\u2019m being rejected by it. I\u2019m scared of getting hurt, so I run away from the people I love. What a good-for-nothing loser.","2294":"*thinking* Normally, one would call an ambulance or ask for help from one of the nearby residents, but this particular boy decided to carry the unconscious, innocent girl... and where the hell are you taking her, bastard?","2295":"I've won. Exactly as planned.","2296":"I know the loneliness of being a prisoner. I know the joy you feel when your friends come to rescue you and the fear of them being injured and defeated.","2297":"I don't want the precious time we have together to be taken away by anyone!","2298":"Blaming others isn't going to resolve anything. There'll be a lot of things that are injust throughout your life. You will have to stand up by yourself.","2299":"I see...since I am no longer going to be Lord Orochimaru's vessel, my duty is to protect the vessel.","2300":"This is the impenetrable wall of Jericho third child. Take one step over this wall, and you will be a dead man.","2301":"There are some things that can only be conveyed through words.","2302":"I can't deny, I don't know very much about Rukia. That's not the point, I might not risk my life for her, but Ichigo wants to save her life and that's all I need to know. What may seem like an unworthy cause to you is more than enough reason for me.","2303":"I want to spend a lot more time with you! But I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m annoying, so I\u2019m holding myself back. When you\u2019re away, I always wonder what you\u2019re doing and thinking.","2304":"Comrade isn't simply a word. Comrades are about heart. It's the unconditional trust in your partners. Please, feel free to lean on me.... And I, too, will lean on you as well.","2305":"Regret is a different beast when you live for centuries.","2306":"You shy, little boy.","2307":"One who relies overly on a single skill will be brought low by that very same skill.","2308":"*to Ohana* You can't do everything by yourself!... But I can't do it by myself, either. I need your help.","2309":"It's a foolish thing, the human heart. Sometimes we fail to operate logically, and act on emotions.","2310":"In the end, there is no greater motivation than revenge.","2311":"You've really got to hold on to what's important to you.","2312":"Inherited will, the swelling of the changing times, and the dreams of people. These are things that cannot be stopped. As long as people seek the answer to freedom, these will never cease to be!","2313":"School trips are simply a simulation of adult social life. If you ever go on a business trip with your boss, you won't get to choose where to stay or what to eat, but if you compromise, you can still have a modicum of fun. School trips train you to trick yourself into that kinda mindset.","2314":"Question: Why can one keep living as a hikikomori?\nAnswer: Because one's food, clothing and shelter are assured. It's because one is permitted a lukewarm bare minimum of a life that one can keep living as a hikikomori indefinitely. Being able to live as a hikikomori was in itself very much a luxury. Without the assurance of food, clothing and shelter, unless you're prepared to die, there's no other way but to work.","2315":"My companions make my heart strong. If I'm fighting for those I love, I care not what happens to this body.","2316":"Excuses are meaningless. The tougher things get, the more likely people are to come to their own conclusions.","2317":"Fortitude is about staying cool and calmly analyzing your opponent. Do you know why? It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you, to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off, to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, thoroughly beat them until they can't get up!","2318":"Everyone dies eventually, whether they have power or not. That's why you need to think about what you'll accomplish while you're alive.","2319":"People with talent often have the wrong impression that things will go as they think.","2320":"Don\u2019t worry about what other people think. Hold your head up high and plunge forward.","2321":"A day when everything is perfect, when everything will turn into memories, will eventually come.  But I'll probably remember over and over again you were there and everyone else was there. The day we all searched for just one thing.","2322":"I always get stuck with unfortunate circumstances.","2323":"Love is when it isn't fun to be with that person. It's when nothing goes the way you want. When you're not having fun... and yet you still want to be with that person.","2324":"If you claim to love humans, that should include their lies and betrayals, their sins and ugliness, their jealousy and immaturity, their hatred and conflicts.","2325":"Hope is harmony. A just heart, moving toward the light. That is all. Despair is hope's polar opposite. It is messy and confusing. Despair swallows up love, hatred, and everything else. Because not knowing where you will end up is despair. Despair is what even you cannot predict. Only despair's unpredictability will save you from a boring future.","2326":"If you still love her, I can't help that, but don't meddle with her half-heartedly. If you can surpress your feelings, then leave it.","2327":"The moment a soldier dons his uniform, he accepts that he might be buried in it.","2328":"I have a dream at last. The butterfly trapped in spiderweb has no wings. That butterfly is... me.","2329":"Ever since I joined the survey corps, I've had people dying on me everyday. But... you understand, don't you? One day or another, everyone you care about eventually dies. It's something we simply can't accept. It's a realization that could drive you insane... It's painful... so painful... I get it. And still... we must keep moving forward.","2330":"Unfortunately, the real world isn't the same as a fairy tale.","2331":"People who abuse power they were born into piss me off more than anything else.","2332":"Only hope can give rise to the emotion we call despair. But it is nearly impossible for a man to try to live without hope, so I guess that leaves Man no choice but to walk around with despair as his companion.","2333":"You believe that the strong exist to cull the weak. To use them as food. But you are mistaken... The strong exist, not to feed off of the weak, but to protect them!","2334":"I would rather be a brainless monkey than a heartless monster. (To Frieza)","2335":"Everyone's carrying something that matters. You just don't realize when you're carrying it. It's only after it slips out of your hand that you realize how heavy it was in the first place. So many times I thought that I'd never carry a load like that ever again. And yet, before I realized it, I was carrying it again. I'd feel so much better if I just got rid of it. But I just can't bring myself to do it.","2336":"I told you before, Komamura. The only paths that I see with these eyes are the ones not dyed with blood. Those paths are the paths to justice. So whichever path I choose...Is justice.","2337":"Romance is just trying to convey your feelings to another person.","2338":"Is that the kinda attitude you show to someone concerned about you?! What's gonna happen to the person who wants to see ya, huh?!?! Its obvious... Its obvious you wish to see each other... SO COME AND FREAKIN' SEE ME ALREADY!!","2339":"Though you fight a fierce battle on the outside, your inner world trembles not the slightest.","2340":"That is when I realized that in all of the world no one needed me. I was alone.","2341":"What about when you reciprocate someone else\u2019s emotions? Is that still coming from you\u2026 or is the air connecting you to one another?","2342":"There are people in this world that enjoy being alone, but there isn't a single person who can bear solitude.","2343":"And yet, at the end of the day, we are just like tree leaves dancing in a whirlpool. No matter how we dance, we are only swallowed by the whirlpool and disappear...","2344":"Do what you can until you learn what you need. If you're going to try something, you may as well aim for the top.","2345":"[to Azula] Please tell me you're here to kill me.","2346":"Wanting to be loved, for that sole obstinate reason, people can even go this far.","2347":"Educating a heterosexual person about anime, is a joy for an otaku.","2348":"Where do people stray off the path? When do they begin to obey their greed rather than their ideals? Or are ideals just prone to morphing easily into greed?","2349":"DON'T CALL ME SMALL! I'LL BREAK DOWN YOUR FEET AND STICK THEM ON YOUR HEAD!!","2350":"The pain... the pleasure... and the shame all drive me crazy.","2351":"Sins you've committed cling to your soul and then continue to haunt you forever.The sins that have gone unpunished don't get forgiven until you die.","2352":"You don't like being lonely, but you're afraid of people expressing their affection towards you. You pretend not to notice. You run away. You brush it off. You cover up. You reject. You even lie to yourself, convincing yourself that no one has any feelings for you.","2353":"I am a single bullet. It has no heart. Therefore, it does not think. It just flies straight towards its target.","2354":"Pitiful shadow cloaked in darkness. Thy action cause men pain and suffering. Thy hollow soul drowns in thy sins. How would you like to see what death is like?","2355":"My childhood was filled with blood and strife. I have never needed love. Not then, not now.","2356":"Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses? There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit.","2357":"STOP IMAGINING ME!","2358":"I no longer even dream, for I no longer sleep. So I had this golden enclosed garden made. However, now the only place where I can be myself is in this room. And my wealth is just this one glass of water.","2359":"He was someone who deserved to die.","2360":"I can't save you. I can't do anything to help you, except stay like this. If only I could stop time.","2361":"People aren't complicated. We work hard when we know that we'll get something in return, and we try to work even harder if that something is our own improvement.","2362":"Nobody can make someone who isn't trying to be happy into someone that's happy","2363":"You know the power of my zanpakuto, Suzumebachi. If someone gets hit twice in the same spot... They die!","2364":"[after finding his stolen boomerang] Boomerang! You do always come back!","2365":"I know everyone has their stories of pain and sadness or things that they don't want to bring up, but if you can't be a good friend without telling that, then I don't need any friends at all!","2366":"Fear deals a crippling blow to soldiers. Be it a single man or a million soldiers, it makes no difference. Man can deny neither hunger nor fear.","2367":"Just as there isn't a problem that can't be solved by being right, there isn't a problem that can't be solved by money.","2368":"Wishes shouldn't be granted. They're better off not coming true. When their wishes aren't granted, people actually put in effort. It's because they don't come true that people make progress. But if all their wishes come true, people won't be able to move forward anymore, you know?","2369":"Everyone is watching someone other than themselves, someone important to them.","2370":"What defines humans... Defines us? Nobody will notice a change on the inside if you look the same on the outside.","2371":"I had totally forgotten!! I am just me.","2372":"And I thought you were going to buy a stone to evolve yourself.","2373":"No one can say they grew up in a sterile room, never failing or making mistakes. Life is an ongoing process of trial and error.","2374":"You're you. \"To be like you...\" - it's not so ambiguous as that. No matter what you do, no matter how you change, it doesn't mean a thing. you're just you, no matter what.","2375":"Hey hun! I've got a great idea, let's trade! Yo take my spot and I'll fight Hercule!","2376":"Eat until you can't anymore, play until you drop, sleep the day away, it's okay to laugh, cry or yell, just live, live, live!","2377":"Forget about me, and starting tomorrow live your own life. Don't keep dragging the dead into your life, otherwise your life would get screwed up and you won't be happy in the future, okay?","2378":"Everyone has to decide for themselves which choice to make. If you fight, people may die... but if you don't fight, people may still die. There's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" choice to make.","2379":"What is love?\nIts when your eyes start following someone, and you look for them if they\u2019re not around. You get excited thinking you might run into him when you\u2019re putting your shoes on in the morning. And when you don\u2019t it\u2019s a little disappointing. But then you pass by him and that makes you happy for the rest of the day. It feels like you can handle anything. Seeing him is enough to make you happy.","2380":"I\u2019d rather have my physical pain exceed my mental pain than the other way around. By hurting myself just enough, I could turn my attention to that.","2381":"Know much about purgatory? It's the place between heaven and hell, where those who were left behind, unable to get into heaven continue to suffer, a place of struggle and pain. In other words, the world that we're in now.","2382":"I guess it can't be helped. I'll bear your sins in your place.","2383":"All things shine at their most brilliant when they're being broken.","2384":"Cry... yell... act tough... be proud of the way you live... LAUGH!","2385":"The concept of lateness being evil is wrong in the first place... The police don't mobilize until after an accident happens, and it's standard for heroes to show up late. But would anyone condemn them for being late? So, speaking paradoxically, lateness is justice.","2386":"I'm hungry! can we just get his damn zombie soul already?","2387":"I hate butterflies. I hate them for being pretty. I hate them for being easy to catch. And having pins stuck through their body and being turned into specimens is what I hate most.","2388":"It will be alright, have faith in yourself. Crona, you will be a Kishin.","2389":"When you're in the darkness, you only sink deeper into it. Keep the light shining.","2390":"Humans have a desire for truth or they have a desire to what they know is the truth. In other words, what the truth is exactly second to that. Be careful of what is the truth and what is lie. In other words, always doubt yourself. Harbor an inner devil as you read along... and I won't forget to add that by that point, you might have already fallen into my trap.","2391":"I'm the one who is grateful. That's because you're all willing to be my friends. For that, I'm grateful.","2392":"I am strong. Stronger than all of you. Extremely strong. I can kill all the titans out there. Even if I am alone.","2393":"Hey! Shorty's a lot cooler than I thought.","2394":"How will you live if every little thing from your memories always hurts you easily?","2395":"With your positions revealed, you\u2019re in my crosshairs. And there\u2019s no hiding from the coming storm. As Hawks would say\u2026 speed beats power.","2396":"Looking at your own memories is recognizing the parts of you that you don't want to face.","2397":"Seeing nature and thinking it's beautiful is what's unnatural. That means the life you lead is an unclean one. If you can cut yourself off from mother nature and still survive, doesn't it mean you have enough inner beauty to allow you to do that?","2398":"My new family is just so kind. It's almost if there's been some kind of mistake... like, I'll have to pay back for all this happiness later on.","2399":"Don't come back... \"Bed-wetter\" Momo.","2400":"We've gone far past the stage of fighting for our honor.","2401":"Having too many bonds causes one to lose focus, weakening their strongest wish, their greatest desire.","2402":"You were always there for me, and that\u2019s all I needed. Just you. For some reason, I didn't feel sad or broken up, it just didn't seem real. But slowly I realized it was real \u2013 that you were gone. And little by little, I slowly felt something inside me go numb.","2403":"I'm not going to lie to you, Vegeta, although the answer may be difficult for you to hear. This is the truth. Goku devoted his life to protecting the lives of other. Because of his selflessness, when he died, he was allowed to keep his body and travel to King Kai's Planet. You, on the other hand, have spent your life in pursuit of your own selfish desires. You've caused too much pain. When you die, you will not receive the same reward.","2404":"This is the law of conservation of mass. Somebody's \"happiness\" is somebody else's \"unhappiness\". That's why I tried to be a \"rubbish bin\" for those guys who played othello on my back using white and black thumbtacks. My crying and screaming meant something, 'cause they were laughing... But I was wrong. It doesn't make sense, does it? If I enjoy being unhappy, that \"happiness\" will make someone else \"unhappy\"!","2405":"Broadly speaking, there are two reasons a person feels the desire to teach something: Either he wants to pass on his successes or he wants to pass on his failures.","2406":"The devil made me do it. It was all his fault. Yup, all him. Look at them shake. I don't blame them. The second I spotted them, I put a lid on the tin and ran away. In other words, I kidnapped them. Is there any way to spin this? I mean, any way to solve the problem?","2407":"I don't need someone as unreliable as you for a partner! (To Tohru)","2408":"Heroic Spirits... I want you to find a path to victory.","2409":"I'm gonna take you out in one giant bug blitzkrieg!","2410":"But, you will not go in there with hopes of winning the tournament the first time you compete. To do so would be arrogant! And arrogance is for fools, not warriors! So you will enter the tournament with the sole purpose of improving your fighting skills.","2411":"I pity you. You just don't get it at all... there's not a thing I don't cherish!","2412":"I'll make you so in love with me, that every time our lips touch you'll die a little.","2413":"In life, it's better to assume that bad things will happen to you rather than good things. You can't look at someone else's success and assume that it will happen to you. There are a lot of people in the world, so it makes sense that one or two of them are going to be fortunate. But there's only one of you. Assuming that good fortune will come to you is no different than pointing a finger at a random person and predicting the same for them. But do you think that prediction would come true?","2414":"Anyone who points a gun at me dies. Got it? Point a gun at me, you die.","2415":"I'm crazy!? What's crazy is this world that refuses to let me be with you!!!","2416":"The biggest idiot is you! So why don't you go back to school or whatever it is that idiots like you do and don't ever bother me again! You piece of shit! (To Yuki)","2417":"Pum, Pum, Pum, Pum. I always get what I want, so just give it to me. Pum, Pum, Pum, Pum. I'm a beauty, beautiful pretty lady. But you know, you know I've got a secret yes I do. Pumpkins, Pum, Pum, Pumpkins. Pum, Pum, Pumpkins because that's my magic spell. Pum, Pum, Pumpkins, Pum, Pum, Pumpkins yeah!","2418":"[To Yubaba] I'm not leaving until you give me a job!","2419":"I heard that when things were painful for her, she'd cover her ears with headphones and escape to the world of music. I tried it too. It was like everything was blown away. The vocals screamed for me. They grieved for me. The ones who put on the act of common sense were wrong. Those who cried were right. We, the lonely were more human. They screamed at the absurd, beat it down, and destroyed it. They saved me.","2420":"Alright then! Come here! Come over here, Black Star's giving you a big hug!","2421":"It's difficult to like me when I'm being myself.","2422":"I refuse to stand by and watch you give up. I won't lose you, I can't. We'll walk away from this battle together.","2423":"Courage is the mindset of not surrendering even if you lack the strength.","2424":"If we give up before we try, then nothing is going to happen.","2425":"This is fear. That's good then, I had forgotten what it felt like.","2426":"*To Haruhi, when at her home*  You like strawberries, right? Here, you can have mine.","2427":"Family is the society that you came into contact with first; The people who influence you first. But if that first society banishes you, there will be another society that accepts you.","2428":"Say good-bye to The Unstoppable Exodia!","2429":"I wonder when I got into the habit of writing messages to nobody.","2430":"Victory isn't something you are given. It is something you take.","2431":"Yeah, I know there's no right answer. All I know for sure is that time keeps on flowing like a river, and a river eventually leads to the ocean. Maybe I will try swimming against the current.","2432":"I shouldn't think about losing before the match has even begun.","2433":"Protect whatever is precious to you. One day it\u2019ll lead you to protect something else.","2434":"Have you ever wondered, Master, what it feels like to be hunted?","2435":"Told you, Rose. Get too close to the sun, and you'll burn.","2436":"[To Orihime] I've repaid my debt to you. Now, you're gonna accompany me on a little errand.","2437":"[to himself as he chops at the ice] I'm just a guy with a boomerang. I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.","2438":"To leave the first tracks, we must go somewhere nobody's been yet.","2439":"Hughes, just a bit of advice. The soldiers who never shut up about their girls back home... They don't make it.","2440":"We weep for the blood of a bird, but not for the blood of a fish. Blessed are those with a voice. If the dolls could speak, no doubt they'd scream, \"I didn't want to become human\".","2441":"\"Those who believe will be saved\". It's just that I wanted to find out whether you'll be saved if you believed. If such a thing were true, I feel like I can change myself too.","2442":"Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature... They are the strong ones!","2443":"What do you think about your world? Is it fun? Is it easy to live in?","2444":"Even if we forget the faces of our friends, We will never forget the bonds that were carved into our souls.","2445":"Isn\u2019t there something strange in becoming friends because you\u2019re asked? Friends aren\u2019t given; you\u2019re supposed to make them.","2446":"However, as always, this girl was thinking up all sorts of nonsensical stuff. I can't help but wonder if there's a black hole inside her head, since her common sense seems to come from a different universe altogether.","2447":"People don't kill people, really. Monsters do. Monsters like war, hungry nobles, and greedy kingdoms. And monsters like me, not you.","2448":"If what you lost was too big and you can\u2019t replace it with something else, you don\u2019t have to replace it with just one thing, right? If you get ten small things or a hundred small things, all together it will be enough of a reason for you to keep going!","2449":"Be thankful for the blood\u2026 You are not allowed to spill even a single drop on the ground\u2026 for if you do\u2026 your torso and head shall have a sorrowful parting.","2450":"[Last words to Hashirama] As comrades, huh... well... if that's how... we... will.... *smiles*","2451":"The world is constantly changing. And you can't expect it to stay the same, even for a second. If that's true, there's no need for you to go on a journey, Kino. Even if you stay in one place, you'll be able to keep experiencing the world.","2452":"That's right, I am Kira. And what can you do? Kill me right here?","2453":"Total victory is scoring an easy win by doing what you always do.","2454":"I am a man with no worth.","2455":"To rule time is to rule the world.","2456":"[to Zuko about Aang] It was not by chance that for generations people have been searching for him, and now you have found him.","2457":"There are no regrets. If one can be proud of one's life, one should not wish for another chance.","2458":"Marriage, the institution where one's existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying \"I'm home!\" to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say \"I'm home!\" if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say \"I'm home!\" to the hippos on the label. And if they're talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they're working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?","2459":"It's not a crime if no one knows about it.","2460":"Even if everyone in the whole world dies, I won't care, as long as my beloved survives.","2461":"There are two kinds of fights. As long as we place ourselves in battle, we must always know the difference, a fight to defend life or a fight to defend pride.","2462":"It's true that you're lacking in ability. That's because you don't work at it. However, you have a natural potential. That's why I chose you.","2463":"The person that needs to be as far away from the H-bomb switch as possible in all of Japan, is right here.","2464":"Kiss my ass.","2465":"\"I would die for you\" is what the weak say. If you're in love with someone - live for them.","2466":"If you want to run from your past, fine. But whatever you do, don't run away from your present or worse, your future.","2467":"I've been thinking about this for a long time. We put all our trust in alchemy but in the end... what is it? \"Alchemy is the science of understanding the flow of matter and its laws. The process of comprehension, deconstruction, and reconstruction. The world flows too. It must also follow laws. Everything circulates. Even death is a part of that circulation. You must accept the flow.\" Hmm, Teacher sure drummed that into our heads, didn't she? I thought I understood it. But I don't understand anything... Mom proves that. Now here I am again, trying desperately to figure out a way to do the impossible. I'm such a hopeless idiot. All this time and I haven't grown up one bit.

It is because one lives, one can enjoy things! Everyone has their own designated place and position in life! This man understands the futility of resisting against that fact! You see, not all living things, are born equal!","2477":"Let me tell you the truth. The truth behind fighting. Fighting continues forever. After you've defeated one person, someone stronger appears. If you manage to defeat him, then an even stronger person comes along. If you don't have the resolve to endure that eternal struggle, then eventually your confidence will erode. But it doesn't end there! The battle will continue elsewhere, fought by others. It's an endless cycle! And it doesn't end with a person's death. The cycle will continue! As long as people and their souls exist, there will be disputes and those disputes will lead to fights. And those fights will continue without limit, for all eternity.","2478":"It's always like this.

No one bothers about things they cannot see... like the heart.","2480":"Happy encounters and bittersweet memories, if there is nothing meaningful in the meeting itself and it's all about having met him, then what would be the true meaning of actually meeting him and the significance of wanting to meet him again?","2481":"Yes I've used a condom before.

Do you see how the very ground shakes beneath me feet?","2486":"Human memories are too vague. Thinking something has color when it doesn't, making things more dramatic than they really are, glorifying things... It gives new greater meaning than was actually there.

Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't get fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you're nice to me, you're nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I always hate nice girls.","2521":"In the end the winner is still the last man standing.","2522":"People can really change. When they're far away from each other, their hearts will change.

A life with no sorrow, no pain, a glorious new beginning. A beginning that will last an eternity.","2535":"I actually don't think something like perfection exists.

Nobody can keep on going without some measure of reward.","2540":"If failure is the hallmark of being young, like they say. then someone who has failed to make friends must be at the peak of his youth, right? However, I'm sure they will disagree. All of this is just their double standards at play and nothing else. Here's the bottom line: Fools that enjoy their youth should go kill themselves.","2541":"A dream? A future?

It hurts.","2550":"There are liars who only lie when there's a reason to, and there are liars who also lie without a reason.","2551":"I don't know which is more pathetic; the fool, or those who follow him.","2552":"It's always a lot easier to let something fall apart, than it is to try to hold it together.","2553":"I find it hard to believe that my cells are in your body. How could you have turned out so ugly? What a waste. Although, it\u2019s obvious where you\u2019ve gotten most of your strength.","2554":"The two of us aren't so different. My whole life I've desired from others. I felt bitter to the people around me and I closed off my heart...and a heart that lets nothing in..will become empty before you realize it. But in this world, you'll sometimes meet meddlesome people who will, even without asking, give you the love you need. And for someone like you or me, meeting such a person is very blissful.","2555":"But they say a woman is better off with an unloved man, versus a man who loves her.","2556":"Everyone is the main character of their own life.","2557":"Either way, the only ones who can die tomorrow are those who survive today.","2558":"That makes four time.

Maybe we'd never even come close. But someone, someday would know we've tried.","2564":"Keeheehe. I like him. I'm going to make him my cat.","2565":"You get free hatred for everything you sell. I've amassed a real supply of it, so I'd like to sell it too... But no one wants to buy it from me!","2566":"I mean, think about it. If someone pointed to a classmate of yours and asked you what they meant to you, how would you answer? What would you say?","2567":"In the end, I couldn't see things from the parasites' perspective, never mind from Migi's. Of course not. It wasn't possible from the beginning. As two different species, we may at times take advantage of each other and kill each other, but it's impossible to understand each other. Actually, you shouldn't even think that you've figured out another species based on your standards. I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a \"friend\" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right. So in the end, it's hypocritical for us to love Earth without loving ourselves.","2568":"What's so fun about firing at targets that aren't moving?","2569":"Symmetry is what makes the world beautiful.","2570":"If you want to get to know someone, find out what makes them angry.","2571":"I'm going to keep fighting until this world is the way it should be.

It's only because I had just woken up, that's why Oz found out. Give me 3 more days. By then, I'll have assimilated. Then I'll be recovered and everything will be like normal. Even if I were thrown in a midst of Pandora members, I have faith that I will be able to kill them all!","2574":"[Kira thinks he has just killed Andrew Waltfeld and cries] It didn't have to end like this.","2575":"According to my master, when you're a kid, just being a fast runner makes you popular. In middle school, it's holding your own in a fight. After that, brains make you popular. Her point seemed to be, \"Run fast, hit hard, and read books.\"","2576":"Being too rigid makes you fragile. You'll end up breaking yourself and those around you.","2577":"Oh crap! Today is Jump release day! I forgot it comes out on Saturday this week! We have to go back!","2578":"There\u2019s no use. There\u2019s no such thing as a victory that can be won through effort. It doesn\u2019t exist.","2579":"[To Gilgamesh] That's right. I don't create swords. I create a world that contains infinite swords. This is the only magic allowed for me. There's no need to be surprised. These are all imitations. As you say, these are all trifling swords.

Here I come, King of Heroes! Do you have enough swords in stock?","2580":"Tell me, how does it feel to live in a constant haze of stupidity?","2581":"What is Living? Living is continuing to make choices. Living is enjoying oneself. Living is continuing to make choices. Living is expressing one\u2019s will. Living is enjoying oneself.

Living is preparing oneself.","2582":"I will do what I can, even if my chance of passing is minuscule, if that will allow me to move forward.","2583":"<About Ciel> He turns his back towards the light without hesitation. That figure that charges into the abyss at a dignified pace. How beautiful and foolish.","2584":"Get your ass moving Kid!","2585":"When you love someone, I think it's only natural to worry about what they love.","2586":"Isn't it arrogant to put a price on whether life is \"higher\" or \"lower\", Kaneki? We are just bags of meat. The weak bow down and the strong devour them. Rather, if you compared them to all living things, it's humans who have shaved away the most lives. We are different than them.","2587":"You don't understand anything, do you?! The most important thing isn't power, it isn't courage, it isn't even having friends! The only thing that matters is that you can rely on ME.","2588":"Everybody's weak. That's why we rely on others. We live by helping one another. We can say, we need one another. I've been able to survive because I have you and the others.","2589":"There is no telling what kind of pain will come  after me, but... if I stop believing because of that, if the hero should change, it'll turn into another story from the one my master left behind.

I could never pass up a great adventure like this!","2591":"When you're old, all you want to do is stare at the scenery. It's so strange. I've never felt so peaceful before.","2592":"If you ask anyone to name a universal rule that governs animals and humans alike, I bet you most people would answer \"survival of the fittest\". There are strong people and there are weak people. At a glance, it looks like the difference is pretty clear-cut. But the truth is, there's a lot more to it than just a simple battle of \"strong\" against \"weak\", of kill or be killed. You must understand what I'm talking about too, right? The true meaning of \"survival of the fittest\" isn't as simple as all that.","2593":"Usually, he just abuses everyone. Normally, he's so sarcastic. But now he's holding me as if I were something precious.","2594":"Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else is just a delusion for the weak.","2595":"Listen up you guys! This is the final battle! Grit your teeth and get ready to go with all your might! We're only aiming to win! It doesn't matter whether we're idiots or ordinary people or smart people! Everyone's to do whatever they can do! We're definitely... going to win this battle! Just watch, 3rd years...! I'm going to smash those heads of yours and show you how capable these idiots you look down on really are!","2596":"I don't regret using my wish for another's sake. If I regret my decision now, the feelings upon which it was based will be for naught.","2597":"Freedom, isn\u2019t something earned through suffering or pushing yourself.

Lust, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Wrath, and Pride. Of course, excessive want will destroy anyone, but those same desires are necessary to understand what it means to be human. Why did you rid yourself of them?","2606":"I believe that love is much deeper than that. It\u2019s much more irreversible. It exceeds just caring for each other and continues until both parties become entangled and inseparable. They combine to form a single concept. They become one. Neither of them must come apart. THAT\u2019S LOVE.","2607":"Justice comes from vengeance, but that justice only breeds more vengeance.","2608":"A fight you can't win becomes an obsession","2609":"I'm too naive.

It's this world that's crazy.","2617":"Whether doing good or evil, I will be the boss.","2618":"To get what you want, you put up with something, make an effort, learn a skill, and inspire yourself. Is that how it is with Hinazuki too? Right now... I can tell she's enduring something. Just the opposite of me, she is pretending to be indifferent.

Like that, be it consciously or unconsciously... People put a lid on their hearts. They want to protect their pride, self-esteem... or whatever.","2630":"Team isn't just something to be protected.

History has shown us this.\nYou could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.","2655":"I hope it's a cool morning. That's how cool days always start out. And a cool guy like me deserves the coolest morning possible.","2656":"Love is like a mirror that reflects your bad side. Especially when it\u2019s unrequited, you get envious, jealous, prejudiced, and resentful. You have to face all sorts of emotions, but there\u2019s no reason to find that shameful. It shows how serious you are. Oh yeah, do you want me to tell you how to break that mirror? It\u2019s not anything hard, understand the other person. That\u2019s all. Don\u2019t make any quick judgment and let them do the same.","2657":"Life is basically like a soap bubble. It rides on the wind, flying here and there... and before you realize it - pop! It's gone. When it's about to disappear, you think that you could've flown a little higher. But by the time, it's already too late.","2658":"Are you afraid? You don\u2019t want to die, do you? Not just Abarai, if anyone\u2026 acts upon the thought of not wanting you to die, you will suddenly begin to fear your impending death, right?","2659":"You can't just wait. You need to make things happen yourself.","2660":"Before I am a Servant, I am a knight. I can only serve but one lord.","2661":"When you point a sword at someone, either you kill them or they kill you, there ain't no in between. So quit talkin' like a fuckin' pussy. Anyone who can't handle that should just SHUT THE FUCK UP and GET OVER IT!","2662":"[About Omashu] There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.","2663":"You, who've taken on his name, have managed \u2013 well, nothing.","2664":"You don't understand death at all. That's why you can't kill me, and why you're only able to kill a weakened woman. If you could see death, you couldn't maintain your sanity. All you can perceive is the part which keeps things alive. If you could see death, you wouldn't be able to even stand... It's like the world on the moon, a desolate wasteland. Being able to see the \"death\" of things means you are forced to see the world's uncertainty and fragility. The ground is like it's not there, and the sky seems about to fall at any moment. You don't know of the illusion that the whole world could perish in an instant. That is what it means to see death. These eyes, this power isn't something you can boast about like you did. Do you see your mistake, now, vampire? Life and death may be back to back, but they will never face each other. I'll show you. This is what it means to kill something.","2665":"Playing is more important. You can work any time.","2666":"Maybe I was lonely. Maybe I've just... always... been lonely.","2667":"You must be prepared to face the worst possible scenarios. Because harsh reality strikes without warning.","2668":"Even if we walk on different paths, one must always live on as you are able! You must never treat your own life as something insignificant! You must never forget the friends you love for as long as you live! Let bloom the flowers of light within your hearts.","2669":"Snowdrop. I also don't know what I'm looking for. What does the future hold? Will I be able to not forget what I have found?","2670":"I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise. I wanted to go into a line of work where I could protect people. That's why I became a detective. But Makishima changed everything. That man will continue to kill people. And yet, the law can't judge him. As long as I'm a detective, I can't touch him. This case made me aware... that the law can't protect people.","2671":"That's right! I admired his desire to save people because it was beautiful! But none of that feeling is my own! What else can you call it but hypocrisy?! I was driven by my obsessive need to help someone. I kept running, neither noticing the pain nor how wrong I was! But it's all a fake. Such hypocrisy can not save anything. No, first of all, I didn't even know what I wanted to save!","2672":"[Referring to Tosen] He's such a boy scout, wouldn't you agree?","2673":"Not bad, for an early prototype.","2674":"There is no match that you know that \"you can't win\". Even if a match like that exists, the thing that decides the defeat is your heart. That makes you think you've \"lost\".","2675":"Yeah I lied; so what is the truth? Underneath the band-aid?","2676":"I am who I am because I learned your ideals and took your prayers to the heart. You've guided me. You've given me a life a mere puppet wouldn't have. You need not to pity me. I am a part of you.","2677":"You've fought a valiant duel, my friend, and this is the hardest move I've ever had to make. But this ends now!","2678":"I\u2019ve always been wondering, even though you\u2019ve been treating me carefully like a princess, are you just trying to keep your distance away from me? You praise me so much and belittle yourself, so I feel that you\u2019re trying to keep your distance away from me...","2679":"It's amazing how every time you open your mouth, you manage to prove you're an idiot.","2680":"When life changes to be harder, change yourself to be stronger.","2681":"Unnecessary thoughts will only interfere with your plays.","2682":"It's okay to feel depressed. It takes time to overcome things. And then, by taking that time, you just start moving forward again. That's just what humans do.","2683":"You may be unfortunate, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer. You may not be blessed, but that doesn't mean you have to throw a fit over it. Even if bad things happen to you, just be strong!","2684":"You may be able to save us. If you stay and protect us. But what's good is that everyone else dies! Please go!! Captain Komamura!!!","2685":"How is this possible? I must be the first person in history who was flushed down the toilet!","2686":"The reader will be me. I have no love, maybe I'll end up interpreting some things in a weird way. However, the reader is free to decide how to read things and with which intonation.","2687":"C'mon, there is no such thing as gross stuff in this world...  Except for GROSSLY CUTE things.","2688":"There are two ways to escape: escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former \"floating\", and the latter \"flight\". You are the only one that decides which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don't choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don't choose the path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the path we choose.","2689":"Even since the industrial revolution, humanity has used its technological knowledge for conflict and repeatedly risked its own extinction. Though great leaders appeared at times, they\u2019d reach the end of their lives in a few decades... and the world would return to a state of chaos.","2690":"I too used to believe that the world would be a better place if I hadn\u2019t been born. I was hated merely for the fact that I existed, and I died for the happiness of many people. But there was one thing I wished for with all my heart\u2026 If I\u2019m ever given a second chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish.","2691":"As long as the kindness received from others... is returned back, it's fine even if it takes time.","2692":"I won't come to hate you! Never! Regardless of what happens in the future!","2693":"\"If I do this, I can stop the rebellion\u201d, \u201cif I do that, I can stop the rebellion\u201d... Open your eyes, princess! Your zealous idealism disgusts me! Ideals can only be spoken by those powerful enough to carry them out. And that excludes you!","2694":"In the end the shape and form don't matter at all, it's only the soul that matters, right? Nothing else.","2695":"Do you know what the most primitive emotion people have is? It\u2019s fear.","2696":"When going on an adventure it's hard to stay calm. As humans, even if we know the adventure will be full of pain and sorrow, we still choose to go on it. Real adventures are not like the ones depicted in games or comic books - they're neither easy nor quick and they can break a person's heart. Real adventures can torment people. They can make you regret ever going on them. But still, that's the true meaning of an adventure. If that's so, then why do we, as people, choose to go on them? Why is that? Because we want to be heroes. Real heroes don't give up, even in front of pain or sorrow or regret! Rather, they want to live a full life. That's what real heroes are!","2697":"There comes a time when we can no longer tell the invaders from the invaded. That is what we call \u201cWar\u201d.","2698":"Don't put me on their level. I don't care about looking interesting. I'm just self-conscious.","2699":"[Sees Yoruichi in cat form] Yes! It's Yoruichi! You've come back! Ha ha ha!! [Picks her up] Come here you little devil, let me take a look at you! You're my fuzzy little troublemaker, yes you are! Now who's your daddy? Hmm?","2700":"I have no parents, and I'm not a product of love. Therefore, I can't understand what a 'good wife' is. Even so... the love he gave me is my entire world. No one can humiliate that.","2701":"I find it fascinating how we can see something with our eyes, hear with our ears and speak from our mouths. Although science tells us how they work, I just really can't grasp it. I don't know how everyday items like phones work. I can't even explain why a bicycle is fast. When I think like this, I wonder how many things I really understand. Yet I can live on. Because all these mysteries have joined together to keep me alive. Sometimes I admire that before I go to bed.","2702":"Mom, you're embarrassing me! In front of all these people? Don't you know I'm a big kid now?","2703":"No matter how much he wants it, he can't be a normal human anymore. *about Rin*","2704":"How should I put this... There are times when you begin to hate everything around you.","2705":"Run until you can't run anymore, and then run again. Constant effort is life's greatest shortcut.","2706":"I never once thought that the world was fair, but some things will never change. If you want things to change, don't wait for someone to do it for you, go change it yourself.","2707":"The bonds we have with those close to us, keep us connected always.","2708":"I never ask them to trust me at all. I told them to come with me but I never told them to trust me. And I always tell them not to trust anyone, including myself. But sadly, there are not many strong enough to do that.","2709":"Don't let yourself be blinded by fear or anger.  Everything is only as it is.","2710":"Neutral Jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.","2711":"Human beings are dangerous. If we're seen, we have to leave. My parents said so.","2712":"Saying that people's personalities are products of their pasts isn't totally wrong. The way people live depends on their experiences.","2713":"There isn't anything that's evil to everyone. Even the worst evil saves something. On the other hand, even the greatest good hurts someone. The phrase \"There are no absolutes in this world\" means there isn't any absolute good or absolute evil.","2714":"You've trapped yourself in a body you hated hiding in the pain, and now you want to torture yourself again for eternity...haven't we both paid enough?","2715":"Every story has an ending. One day, we won\u2019t be able to stay together.","2716":"I decided to stop calling out for someone who would never call back.","2717":"I hate Shinigami.","2718":"We humans can indeed lose again something we've lost already.","2719":"Memories - they can sometimes become vague and foggy and there are times when they disappear altogether. Therefore, because there are many things I don't want to lose track of, I will record everything in here (his diary) for the sake of those moments that should not be forgotten.","2720":"I don't think I'm cut out for manual labor. I need to get a more creative job, like saving the whales.","2721":"If there's someone you wish to see, then you are no longer alone.","2722":"Once you see a guy ignore the light in order to cross the street, you just can't stand still.","2723":"Do you know what's the most important thing about climbing mountains is? It's not about having the courage to challenge it, It's about having the courage to back down.","2724":"Even if you're trying to protect someone, you must never use your power to hurt others.","2725":"You don't know anything. What the hell is up with you? Trying to be the hero? Feel like some all-powerful main character? So annoying! Why? When? Where? What? How will you do and just who will you become? You're just pretending by spouting your ideals! You have nothing! You won't become someone.","2726":"We should be driven by things like our desires, instincts, and impulses. That's how it should be.","2727":"There's no lack of painful things in this world, but hunger and loneliness must surely be two of the worst. Thanks to you, I didn't know a moment of either of them.","2728":"This blank space represents infinite potential. One day, it may become anything.","2729":"Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. You don\u2019t know her circumstances, do you!","2730":"Luxury means something with no meaning at all","2731":"If you don't take risks, you can't create a future.","2732":"If we're going to regret it either way, then let's regret doing something fun that we wanted to do.","2733":"Even now, twenty centuries after the death of Christ, the world is a long way from peace.","2734":"Become strong not just for your own sake, but for your friends.","2735":"Money can buy companionship, but not its quality.","2736":"Our souls, together till the end!","2737":"Assassins Rule Number Three - Speed: Take out the target before the target notices your presence.","2738":"When people focus on what they want to do, they\u2019ll show off an inexplicable charm.","2739":"A beautiful speech, I can see it now, you truly are a prince with the royal blood of a Saiyan.","2740":"My name is Krad.

Who you callin' ugly?! C'mere you mouse!","2746":"Humans aren't made perfectly. Everyone lies. Even so... I've been careful not to tell lies that hurt others.","2747":"Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!","2748":"Crying when you need to cry is another way to show strength.","2749":"Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skip for three days in a row, it'd be really hard to convince yourself to go back.","2750":"This is exactly why I detest adults! You always have such a parochial approach, always trying to force the rules of your petty world onto others!","2751":"You have already fulfilled my expectations. It appears that you\u2019re still hiding a wealth of potential. I was watching you while your Guardians struggled to overcome their trials, and I could tell from your behavior and actions that you were always putting them first. And that didn\u2019t change when Daemon set his trap. I witnessed your resolve to protect your Family, and I was impressed. Your Guardians also responded similarly. Sawada Tsunayoshi, I deem you worthy as boss of the tenth-generation Vongola Family","2752":"Reaper Combat Art: Mortal Sin Stance.","2753":"Everyone makes mistakes. What's important is how to make up for it.","2754":"The world... is a very small place, but... for those who know it, it is very, very large. And the world... when it is viewed by those who know... is far larger than just one world can hold.","2755":"Fear is necessary for evolution. The fear that could be destroyed at any moment.","2756":"I'm gonna kick your ***.","2757":"What if, and this is strictly hypothetical, what if you could reload your save data to change your previous choice, like in a game? Would it change your life? The answer is a resounding no.","2758":"(Her dad) He'd always tell me that family isn't about being related by blood. Living under the same roof and caring for each other is what family is all about.","2759":"I've liked him for so long. So long. But Mayama likes someone else. But I wanna hear his voice. I want to hold his hand. I feel like this.","2760":"Knowing more means having more shit to deal with, you know.","2761":"Humans cannot create anything out of nothingness. Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding onto something. After all, humans are not gods.","2762":"The past and the future are not the same, but they're not completely separate either.","2763":"People like you disgust me. You can't even face your own weakness.","2764":"If we understood how other people felt, then nobody would ever start wars!","2765":"That's people for you. Trusting one another, helping one another- it's all a fantasy. Humans are creatures that will always betray.","2766":"Life is short so it will be appreciated. We live to our fullest due to that.","2767":"[thinking as Nel tells her to cheer for Ichigo] That's right. To begin with, I came here just thinking I wanted to protect everyone. But when I heard they had come to save me, I couldn't help but feel a little glad, just a bit in my heart. When I look at Kurosaki-kun in that mask, I think that he might not have come here to save me at all. Even though it's wrong, they shouldn't be going that far for me.","2768":"Remember how you're supposed to let go right away when you fall off a horse and hit the ground? You don't need to hurt yourself for no reason. If you don't let go, you'll get dragged by the horse and get hurt.","2769":"People like you... are the reason why people like me need medication.","2770":"Exactly when did I say that I do this because I am a shinigami? My killing you is no other reason than the fact that you... Pointed your blade [view shifts to Rukia] at my pride.","2771":"When saying good-bye to this world, our great father split his blood into four: the eldest inherited only his sense of responsibility, the second eldest inherited only his easygoing personality, the youngest inherited only his innocence, and me, well, I inherited only his idiocy.  What held us diverse brothers together was the love of our mother, deeper than the sea, and the farewell we bid our great father.  Sometimes, one profound separation can unite the ones left behind.","2772":"When a dog soils the carpet, its master is responsible.","2773":"You know, it'd really be embarrassing to get eaten by something that came out of an egg this tiny.","2774":"Fine then, in exchange, you can roam around looking like a cosplayer, violate weapon laws, get arrested by the police, and get interviewed on television.","2775":"You were wrong on two counts. Even the hardest substance can be broken, when crashed into itself. And the ability to feel pain is not a weakness. It\u2019s a strength. Pain tells a creature its vulnerabilities, and not you expose them to attack. Your robot is dead. And so, I\u2019m afraid, are you.","2776":"We are weak Mumei. But, that doesn't mean we just roll over and accept our fate.","2777":"When you're in a town like this, all covered with smoke - you forget that there's a world outside. Nothing amazing happens here. And you get used to that. Used to a world where everything is ordinary. Every day we spend here is like a whole lifetime of dying slowly. But now Haruko is here. That's how I know there really is a world outside.","2778":"Look at the sky, it's so far away. But right here, right now, it seems so close.","2779":"Even if you're not interested, just read my recommendation. Putting aside disliking the food before trying it, I won't forgive you if you dismiss manga without giving it a chance.","2780":"I never rely on luck. It's all my own choice. It leads me to the future.","2781":"I woke up feeling refreshed, after dreaming about a long shower.

Calling any choice I made a mistake would be calling who I am now a mistake.","2785":"You said I should have forgotten everything and lived as a human, but... there's no way I could do that. At that time, Teresa was everything to me. Everything I lost... my life, my voice, even my joy in living... Teresa gave those back to me. Teresa gave me everything. So I had no choice but to move forward. I wasn't strong enough to forget all that and continue living.","2786":"That dog is neither man nor monster.

But I don't want to be an adult who pretends to be satisfied with it!","2790":"With so much time left, I thought I\u2019d park myself at the gate\u2026 but, well, taking that approach is just no fun at all\u2026 Because watching you run and shriek like a baby\u2026 makes the sadist in me ache for a chance to play.","2791":"The world is full of choices unseen. With the willingness to notice, anyone can choose a world of their very own, from an infinity of choices.","2792":"I still don't know where to find happiness. But I'll continue to think about whether it's good to be here... whether it was good to have been born. But in the end, it's just realizing the obvious over and over again. Because I am myself.","2793":"Yeah, it's still a nameless sniper. It's become quite a topic among us. She's still a cadet from the military academy, but at any rate she's got a good arm. It seems she's been brought all the way out here. Hah... to think they have to pull out even a little chick like that... this must be the end.","2794":"There's always something one can't explain even if one has experience with it.","2795":"We could drive them off the entire earth if we had your strength, Gintoki!","2796":"Do you have something you want from me? You\u2019re in quite a panic.","2797":"Ayuzawa, you are the first person ever to appear in my life and able to make me a mess.","2798":"I was the only one who got an A ranking for the Public Safety Bureau. There were more than 500 students and I was the only one. So I thought that there must have been something that only I could do at the Bureau. If I went there, I thought I could find my purpose in life... I thought I'd be able to find out why I was born here and now!","2799":"You see, I'm sure we can change, because we're weak. And because we die. We have to fight in order to live, and that is what will make us strong.","2800":"Don't mistake borrowed power for your own ability!","2801":"Cast aside the illusion that there is a beginning and end to the story. The story has no beginning. And it has no end. All there is, is a performance of people connecting, living, influencing each other, and departing.","2802":"I always lied to you telling you to forgive me. I used these hands to keep you at distance... I did not want you to get involved. But now... I think you could have changed father and mother. Perhaps even the entire Uchiha. If I would have stood in front of you and looked you in the eyes from the very beginning... talked to you instead of down to you... and been open about everything. But I failed, and speaking to you now, like this, isn't going to undo the permanent damage that's already been done to you. That's why I wanted to show you the truth. Even if it's just a little. And no matter what you decide to do from here on out, you never have to forgive me - I will always love you.","2803":"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.","2804":"You see, I really hate the word \"responsibility\" saying something or doing something \"it's your responsibility\" \"take responsibility\" making a \"selection\" always comes with \"responsibility.\" That's why I abandoned \"selection\" therefore, I don't have to bear any responsibility anymore.","2805":"They say that we should love ourselves first, before other people learn to love us, but it's not as easy as it seems. Sometimes, we need someone to accept us and love us first, then we would learn to see ourselves through that person's eyes and learn to love our-self.","2806":"All I need is the power to be able to protect my comrades. So long as I can have the strength to do that, I don't care if I'm weaker than everyone else in the world.","2807":"Even though I've lost my way, I will save you.","2808":"Even if a question has a proper answer, sometimes one cannot simply give it away.","2809":"In this world, there are very few people who actually trust each other.","2810":"My soul wave length just got taken away. I'm gonna miss it.","2811":"I kinda like that about you. If only everyone had the guts to fight for each other like you do, the world might have been a better place.","2812":"I would be nothing without you.","2813":"Stay the fuck back, you freak!","2814":"Are you stupid?","2815":"Those who underestimate their enemies will not last long in this world.","2816":"The disturbance in the stitch, is a disturbance in the heart.","2817":"If all the villains attacking tonight are on his level\u2026 everyone\u2019s in trouble.

There's something to be said for not having... even one regret.","2822":"All they saw in me was another little ghetto rat with no power and no God.

That isn't the life I had anymore. It's someone else's life. Everyone only gets to live life one time [Yuri places her hand on her chest.], and it's right here. I only get it once. This is my life. I can't entrust it to someone, I can't steal a new one, I can't force it on others, I can't forget it or erase it. I can't stomp over it, laugh at it, or beautify it! I can't anything! I'd have to accept my one shot at life no matter how cruel, merciless, or unfair I thought it was! Sir, don't you understand? That is why I must fight. I must keep on fighting!

If you have time to give up or hold a grudge against that injustice, then use that time to enjoy battling those injustices instead.","2835":"Mages of Fairy Tail... specialize in property damage!","2836":"No matter how deep the night, it always turns to day, eventually.","2837":"It doesn't matter where I look, it's always idiots as far as the eye can see.","2838":"If you're alone... if it's just your life, you can use it however you please\/ Wear yourself out, get cut to ribbons, doesn't matter. But when there's two, the blade grows heavy. Fighting like death doesn't concern you becomes a thing of the past. It's no longer just you. I threw away my way of life, relied on the strength of others, and somehow pushed on.","2839":"*to Alucard* Demons do not cry... You became a demon, because you couldn't cry anymore, right? Humans cry, and when their tears finally run dry, there is nothing left, but a demon, nor a monster, and one finally prayer for death...","2840":"If this is the path you choose to walk... I will not interfere. But if you turn the people against you... Will you be able to function as a hero? This worries me. But if you ever get in a tight spot... I will be there.","2841":"Forget what hurt you in the past, but never forget what it taught you.","2842":"Take advantage of what you have, while you have it.","2843":"We're not going to sneak in, we're gonna bust in. To bust in means to go in from the front, guns blazing.","2844":"Humans are so... interesting.","2845":"That\u2019s right. I\u2019m nice. After everything that has happened in my life, I still haven\u2019t gone after anyone or anything in revenge. If I were normal I would have destroyed the world by now. In a sense it makes me a savior of sorts.","2846":"Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl!","2847":"The only thing you can change about the past is how you feel about it in the present.","2848":"Falling is just another way of flying.","2849":"Smile. Not for anyone else, but for yourself. Show yourself your own smile. You'll feel better then.","2850":"Bruises and fractures heal with time, but the wounds in people's hearts do not heal as easily.","2851":"You know, I discovered something. Everyone has something... Something deep inside their hearts. For some, it might have been enmity. For others, admiration. Wishes, a craving for the spotlight, feelings that one wants to deliver, feelings for one's mother. Everyone was supported by their own feelings. I realize now that, perhaps, no one can stand alone on stage.","2852":"To become Hokage is my dream!","2853":"Dressing up on the outside won\u2019t change what\u2019s on the inside.","2854":"You can't just run away, especially from the things you want to forget!","2855":"The envy of a man runs deeper than a woman's, surprisingly.","2856":"My heart is a cold cage where lies a person far more than my self, with an eye that can see the truth but reflects nothing, a cold stare from a distant person that use to know how to smile.","2857":"The main reason I got stronger was so I\u2019d be able to survive.","2858":"I wouldn't call myself a saint, but I think I do alright. My mind's about as sharp as the average person. When it comes to an iron will or noble spirit, well... I might have to ask you to turn a blind eye there...","2859":"You want to walk into a Fire Nation town when they're all fired up with their, you know, fire?","2860":"Death is never an apology.","2861":"He feared sleep. He'd say that his soul would slip down into nothing. They say that man never dreamt after the day he cut his pillow.","2862":"Aside from the fact that I don't have any friends or girlfriends, I'm still a high quality product!","2863":"Hatred will never be erased! The only thing you can do... is erase the ones you hate!","2864":"Where in this world can a sane man be found? We're the same. We're all the same. None of us understands what it means to love all. Or the meaning of life...Or the meaning of death...Or the meaning of our own battles.","2865":"Even if you have regrets, even if you have remorse, you must fight. If you have made the decision for yourself to fight, to struggle, then fight with all you have. Do not give up for one second, one moment, or one instant.

You must fight!","2866":"Kurosaki Ichigo, you have no chance of defeating me. Even if you somehow manage to defeat me, there will be three more powerful than myself for you to fight. It doesn't matter if you stand up again a thousand times. The road to victory does not exist.","2867":"The same melody repeats itself as the song grows richer and more beautiful. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could live seemingly constant lives while experiencing changes bit by bit?","2868":"Self-sacrifice... A nameless shinobi who protects peace within its shadow. That is a true shinobi.","2869":"What do you think people are made of? I'm not talking about blood or flesh. We do care about what's on the exterior, but we want to focus more on what people even now still call the \"inside.\" You can also call it \"nature\". I guess you are either born this way or raised to act this way. Are people born like this or do they become like this? The answer is...","2870":"Every individual human affects the surrounding environment. But humans do not exist for the things and people around them. Often, they mistakenly think that they wish to exist for the sake of others, or to help everyone. They can not accept that they don't know why they exist, yes? They always want an answer. That is the nature of the animals called \"humans\".","2871":"Humans will wither away if they're always alone. The only remedy would be to seek out other people.","2872":"Urushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No. More feminine than ANY woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight and yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.","2873":"A little bit of trouble keeps life from being boring.","2874":"Making a fuss won't fix anything.","2875":"Because we can\u2019t understand each other, it makes us want to make things clear even more.","2876":"I want Dr. Verde's intellect. In all honesty I wish he were just a brain and nothing more.","2877":"I think that loving someone is utterly useless. The more you want to be loved the more it will make you miserable","2878":"Hey, Tsubaki, come out of there already. You haven't lost to him, have you? You can put on a better show than that, come back out on stage. Encore, encore. Tsubaki encore, give us an encore!","2879":"Kabuto: Isn't acknowledging what you can't do the same as giving up?\n\nItachi: No, it means to forgive yourself for what you aren't able to do.

What's the point in hurrying, we're already three hours late.","2882":"They say that the best blaze burns brightest, when circumstances are at their worst.","2883":"That's interesting. Don't do it again.","2884":"No man's life is worth more than another! If you're gonna put your life on the line, you do it as equals! I don't care if you're brothers, or master and apprentice, or whatever! You should only die for a guy who'd die for you! There's nothing honorable about throwing your life away as though it's nothing! That's just showing off like a kid.","2885":"I lost my mother when I was 8...and killed my father when I was 10. Those with the title of \"Executive\" or above...are my \"family\", with whom I've shared my joys and sorrows. They're the only thing I have! I won't forgive anyone that laughs at my family. Understood?","2886":"Trying without the winning intent is meaningless.","2887":"To have a name. To remove one layer of the unknown. To be painted in reality.

Giving them a place where they can be happy.","2889":"There are those people who are born aloof and prefer to stay away from groups. In such a case, others should just leave those people alone. It's not a matter of sympathy.","2890":"[after the client asks Shinpachi, Kagura and Ayame to get him stronger] Well, whatever. At any rate, raise his hit points another hundred or so.","2891":"I dislike things. When a person dies, their things are left behind. I`d like to take care of mine ahead of time.","2892":"I can't develop feelings. That's how most idiots screw up.","2893":"The closer you are to someone, the more you have to put things into words to get your feelings across.","2894":"Those three are best friends.  They have their respective secrets.  And they're deliberately trying not to give themselves away.  But neither Orihara or Shizuo had any secrets whatsoever.  And that resulted in the complete opposite kind of personal relationship.","2895":"The \"tsun\" personality is an armor that protects purity. An iron virgin.","2896":"Let me teach you a thing. Normally the weak person's weakness is the strong person, but the strong person's weakness is also the weak person.","2897":"I'm saying that practically nobody feels that they're talented. That's what makes us strive to improve. As we strive to improve, we notice the people around us improving too, which makes us work even harder. I guess you could say friends are like rivals, in a way.","2898":"If you keep on hiding your true feelings, who is going to be happy? If you are sad, you should say it out loud!","2899":"In the darkness, hope is something you give yourself.","2900":"I'm not interested in fighting. What I'm interested in is living.","2901":"The doors here only open one way. They open inward.","2902":"While we are talking of peace, people are dying.","2903":"It's natural for a person to deny he's a failure as a human being. That's why he searches for somebody who is more miserable than himself. That's why so much animosity exists on the internet. Those who aren't able to find a more miserable person, turn to the internet and call other people losers, even though they've never met. Just to make themselves feel superior. Isn't that pathetic? There's a sense of security that comes from speaking badly of someone else. But that isn't true salvation.","2904":"Repeat. I'll repeat it for however many times I have to. Until I find the only way out.","2905":"The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won't flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don't go the way he wants them to. That won't help fill the hole in your heart. And people won't help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don't give up, there will always be salvation.","2906":"Don't think, Natsu! It's not like you!","2907":"If you endure too much, it'll be your loss.","2908":"Anyone who hurts my sister\u2026 Hashira or not, I won\u2019t let you get away with it.","2909":"Even in the darkness, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s reassuring to have someone there to walk with you.","2910":"Sometimes I do feel like I\u2019m a failure. Like there\u2019s no hope for me. But even so, I\u2019m not gonna give up. Ever!","2911":"You can look high or low but you wont find a bigger guy than me!","2912":"God is emotional bullshit.","2913":"And so it all begins. This boy's name is Yusuke. He's 14 years old and is supposed to be the hero of the story... but oddly enough, he's dead.","2914":"Who\u2019ll give up when it comes to such a mere setback? We haven\u2019t lost yet! We\u2019ll kneel on the floor and regret only after all possibilities are exhausted!","2915":"Everyone Makes Mistakes. But people's feelings can manifest through the most subtle of expressions.","2916":"You are calm and composed. You are able to see through things clearly at this age. You are outstanding. And... Always being able to make the correct judgments, not falling into darkness. Outstanding. \"That won't do\", \"This is wrong\". You reject any number of paths... Choosing your path with cynicism. What do you want to do? How are you going to do it? What is your motive? Where do you want to move forward to? Say it. Hmm? Fine. Then stick to the ground forever to move forward, you creep. You little coward who can only move forward by using the method of elimination. Until you found something to reject... You shall just lie on the ground helplessly.","2917":"Isn't chasing our dream our job right now?","2918":"Aw, man. You're such a friggin' disgrace. I can't believe I spent so much time trying to defeat such a coward. Now get up and fight!","2919":"[to Szayel Aporro Grantz] Immaculate being... Was it? In this secular existence, perfection is an illusion, regardless of those who utter the contrary. This is the reality. Common man seeks it out, they strive to achieve it, as if it were some tangible thing... But... The fact of the matter is, perfection is a hollow shell. It is devoid of any substance. I spit on perfection. Perfection, after all, implies you've reached the summit. No trial and error, no ability to conceptualize. An omniscient being would have no need for such superfluous things... Am I making myself clear? For people who dabble in the sciences, such as ourselves, perfection would make us obsolete. Many magnificent things have been, and will continue to come into existence... And yet every last one of them will fall short of perfection's finish. Our function as men of science relies on their many shortcomings. Then, and only then, can we apply the fruits of our labor. To put it simply... As soon as you began spouting that nonsense about being an immaculate being... your fate was sealed. How dare you call yourself a man of science?","2920":"I am not so noble that I would stake my life for someone else. Nor am I so forgiving that I would sit by and allow someone to trample me. I am selfish... and self righteous human being! That's why! I... to clear my own shame... I used your power. Not for anyone else! But for myself!","2921":"You think something like that would hurt, after all I've been through?","2922":"Hey, Oz. what are you lazing around for?","2923":"Where's the fun in it if everything is going just as planned?","2924":"Come again, Needle Noggin?","2925":"Maybe the future is bad. But there's a future beyond that, right?","2926":"I have a confession. I love special things.","2927":"Does he really believe we would turn around after all that we've been through?","2928":"The more you want something, the harder it is to wait for it.","2929":"Tests are a good thing. The knowledge gained from a night of cramming will be all but forgotten once you hit adulthood. And that's fine. The experience you gain through competition, having sharpened your skills and broadened your minds all under the same set of rules? That's the real treasure.","2930":"You've set fire to my frozen heart, I shall engrave this anger and sadness that's running through my blood onto you.","2931":"The fact that you consider yourself as an equal to me, is being arrogant in itself.","2932":"Bury the pain of losing your loved ones... into the arms of your friends.","2933":"Living should mean no do-overs. This is for the best.","2934":"Resignation is what kills people. Once they've rejected resignation, humans gain the privilege of making humanity their footpath.","2935":"We're pulling a big job here! Get lost, kid!","2936":"Once you get everything back, you'll be down to having nothing but loads of fun left.","2937":"Tomorrow's promise will never come. I wonder how many of tomorrow's promises have disappeared as though they have never existed.","2938":"You will not touch these innocent people with even one inch of your dirty blades, if you require an opponent, I will fight you. If you wanna taste the ground, feel free to attack me.","2939":"Clausewitz, he pointed out that no matter how carefully one plans, on the battlefield, even the smallest of details can cause setbacks. Regardless of how well-thought it is, armchair strategizing only works in the realm of theory. Unexpected troubles, or uncontrollable factors such as weather. Operations face those sorts of troubles. They are the cause of strife on the battlefield.","2940":"My legend dates back to the 12th Century you see. My legend is quite old. The 12th Century was a long time ago.","2941":"If we continue on the same path, we are likely to meet again.","2942":"Loving a person isn\u2019t about logic or reason.","2943":"Chicks dig guys in black.","2944":"Unlike demons, you\u2019re base, you harbor a complicated malice, you lie\u2026 You struggle desperately, knocking down others in your way\u2026 You steal and are stolen from, you make endless excuses\u2026 And still you strive to get over the hill and far away. I suppose that\u2019s why humans are so interesting.","2945":"Humanity will never stop fighting itself.. until it shrinks to a size of one or fewer.","2946":"I don't care what the society says. I've regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to.","2947":"To hate something that you used to love is such a painful feeling.","2948":"One day, we will vanish. New senshi and new stars will be born. But you, Sailor Moon, you will forever be immortal. You will be the most beautiful star shining in the sky for eternity.","2949":"Having someone to lean on is an amazing thing. Some things that can't be done alone can be achieved with the courage of two. And in times when you try your hardest and still can't make it work. When it's so tough you're ready to cry... if you have someone there to support you, you can make it through. The smallest words of support can save you.","2950":"Next time I really am going to kill you Medusa ribbit!","2951":"Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing...that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands... But don't you see? It's an empty existence... to go on living... alone and unloved... when defeat's already cost you your dream!","2952":"Someday you'll let go of my hand. When you finally look to the far, far sky, I'll kick you from behind and laugh at you to hurry.","2953":"They call each other friends, but they are either using others or being used themselves.","2954":"If you don\u2019t interact with the people around you, it\u2019d be hard for anyone to approach you.","2955":"It's true that your luster may not have been as bright as gold. You only shined on occasion. You were always arguing and fighting. You have wavy hair. You were lazy. You were the king of sexual harassment. You never paid the rent. You paid your people late. Still, you were brighter than the fake glint of gold plating. When you were angry, your entire soul was enraged. When you laughed, you laughed with all your heart. Your silver was much more beautiful.","2956":"Human emotions are just black or white sometimes there and consistent and can even be contradictory, but that's all right.","2957":"My mind is being eaten away... Kaji-san, it's unravelling my mind! What do I do? It's defiling my mind!","2958":"Hey, why does this situation look like something at the end of a shonen manga?!","2959":"Everyone makes mistakes the first time around.","2960":"In exchange for gaining strength, have I lost something more important as a human being? Emotions used to swirl within me when I fought. Fear, impatience, anger... But now... Day after day, after one punch I go home unharmed and wash my gloves.","2961":"I don't have any wishes that won't come true or that are impossible. Because if it's a dream I can't reach by myself, I won't even dream it in the first place.","2962":"Kisuke and I used to play here when we were kids. We modeled the one under his shop after this one. It was our own secret playground.","2963":"If you tell a bald man his head is useful in the dark, you'll get punched in the face. Santa Claus says such cruel things.","2964":"You\u2019re wrong! None of that makes any sense! Grief and suffering isn\u2019t something that can be taken away by dying in a fight! You have to resolve your problems by talking and explaining your points of view. Relying on others for it is wrong!","2965":"I don't like lectures from someone who plays fixed matches.","2966":"I\u2019m gonna beat you all. Enjoy your win. It\u2019ll never happen again, Dammit!","2967":"If you don't believe in history... Just believe in the world you see with your own eyes.","2968":"There will come a time in a man's life, when he must accomplish something at the risk of his life.","2969":"Well, life is like the weather. It can be sunny or cloudy. Sometimes it rains, and sometimes it storms.","2970":"There is a difference in the look of the ordinary vagabond and that of a determined man.","2971":"I believe there are many things in this world that people haven't seen yet. If you really want to see something, there's nothing you can't see. You can't see it because you're closing your eyes on purpose. Because if you use your eyes to see it, it'll be painful, and sad. That's why they're closed in the first place. I think photography is like borrowing someone else's eyes. So even if your eyes are closed... you can borrow someone else's.","2972":"I'm sure it's not wrong for people to want to understand each other. And even if it is, I want us to understand each other.","2973":"Forget about revenge, and live on.","2974":"Darkness. When everything that you know and love is taken away from you so harshly.

This world is so entertaining because it doesn't do anyone's bidding!","2977":"Accept that your life will be painful, bite back your grief and find the power to stand again.","2978":"What's the point of worrying about the past? A real star keeps moving forward.","2979":"In order to measure a person\u2019s worth, you must do more than push them. The real way to test their worth is to give them power. When they gain the freedom to act outside the boundaries of law and ethics, you can sometimes see their souls. When the weak become strong... When good citizens become free to engage in violence... I'm interested to see what is the outcome of that.","2980":"People tend to push the pain they're burdened with onto other people.","2981":"If you run now, you will be running for the rest of your life.","2982":"The gush from my fountain of wisdom told me.","2983":"Not all people in prison are criminals","2984":"That's right. It's not like I ever felt superior to anyone else because I could see ghosts. And I never planned to take it up as a profession. Hell, I never even felt the need to use my ability to help others. All I ever wanted was the normal life I couldn't have. I've finally achieved what I always wanted.","2985":"In this world, guns are always within arm's reach, and sadly they are more trustworthy than kindness.","2986":"Going against the flow\u2026 takes a lot of courage.

I\u2019ll show them I\u2019ve got what it takes to make it to the hero course, and I\u2019ll become a greater hero than all of you.","2990":"If you trust in the possibilities within and try with all your might, the path will show itself to you!","2991":"Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because. No matter how pathetic the reason, it's enough to start a war.","2992":"You know about it, don't you, Witch Medusa? About the Kishin beneath the DWMA.","2993":"People say that if you fight, it means you're close to someone; but in the end, a fight is just a collision of egos. People don't learn to understand each other just by laying bare their feelings.","2994":"One's true worth shows as hardship increases.","2995":"This world revolves around two views on the same thing. In addition, it's about laughable miseries.","2996":"Courage is a word of justice. It means the quality of mind that enables one to face apprehension with confidence and resolution. It is not right to use it as an excuse to kill someone.","2997":"If you follow the rules, there's no way you can outdo them.","2998":"But that's why I can't let myself be weighed down by fuckin' regrets. A bitch lives as free as a bird that can never be caught.","2999":"I am a god with a heart, but there\u2019s one thing I cannot tolerate\u2026 people who don\u2019t pay their proper respect to others.","3000":"Even in moments of the deepest despair... I guess we can still find hope, huh?","3001":"All humans die the same, the place they go after death isn't decided upon by a god it is Mu (nothingness).","3002":"If you forget your fear you become reckless.","3003":"It's only natural for the girl you're crushing on to be in love with someone else. Since you're in love with her, she sparkles in your eyes. That's why people fall so irrationally in love.","3004":"Shut it! Do you know the pain of having a permanent perm?!","3005":"Even if mistaken, even if cruel, even if stupid, if many people acknowledge it, I found out that it can become the right thing. I found out that righteousness was able to be infinitely mass-produced. I found out that righteousness was established by the number of people. I found out that maneuvering for a majority was everything.","3006":"I don\u2019t want to waste a single second or meter. From your first step and second of the day, I want to be with you.","3007":"[to the Sound Ninja Four] Which do you prefer? To die, or to obey?","3008":"If you don't risk your life, you can't create a future. Right?","3009":"Until just recently, the stars were something I only saw by myself.","3010":"How rude! You knocked his block off, and you didn't even have the courtesy to yell 'Heads up'!","3011":"If you do this, we just might win. But there\u2019s no time to hesitate, so do it now!

Move like the lightning. Be as impenetrable as a shadow.","3024":"Why don't you stop forcing yourself on him and calling it love? It's painful to watch (to Kagura about Kyo)","3025":"I'm a coward. But I wanted to stay by your side. The truth is I was so happy to hear that you needed me, I took advantage of your words. But you're crying again, because of me. I'm no blessed vessel.

What\u2019s necessary is not punishment, but to deal with that desire.","3116":"Don't you ever worry about it? Wonder if there's something wrong with you? When you're always alone... you start comparing yourself with others. You want to make sure you're normal. But... when you're around lots of people, you don't compare yourself with them.

Rather than dreading the day we have to part, shouldn't we be happy that we had the chance to meet today instead?","3221":"On a Monday, God created the world. \nOn Tuesday, God drew the line between Order and Chaos. \nOn Wednesday, God arranged each and every number. \nOn Thursday, God permitted the ebb and flow of Time. \nOn Friday, God explored every nook and cranny of the world. \n\nOn Saturday, God rested. \nAnd on Sunday, God... \nforsook the world.","3222":"A lie is truth, until you recognize it as a lie. To see the truth behind those lies is probably the right thing to do. However, it may not necessarily bring happiness. Lies are Happiness.","3223":"If I sit like a normal person my investigative abilities are only working at 50% efficiency.","3224":"You see, for as long as we draw breath into our lungs, we shall keep hope alive inside our hearts.","3225":"If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive.","3226":"There are people in this world who don't understand that what they consider a harmless prank can deeply hurt someone else.","3227":"Entire civilizations were built and destroyed between now and the last time you said \"we'll go soon\"! I'll have rotted and turned to ash by the time this \"soon\" of yours comes!!","3228":"Seriously, enslavement is funny...","3229":"That\u2019s something you can\u2019t know until you've tried it, and you still won\u2019t understand after you play. I've been playing for 45 years and I still don\u2019t understand. I've never been able to figure it out. That\u2019s why I keep playing.","3230":"Whatever happens, happens.","3231":"We should work towards world peace. Like giving everyone in the world an Upa cushion...","3232":"No one's more aware of discrimination than the ones being discriminated against, huh?","3233":"I won\u2019t lose to my own decisions, no matter what. That\u2019s the proof that I\u2019m me.","3234":"People aren't as complex as you think they are. They're simple, and they get sad or angry over simple things. That's how they are. They're quickly affected by the littlest things, and live without knowing where they're going to fall down. That's who people are!","3235":"It was my fault. It was my carelessness that led to Mitsukuni's cavity. I forgot to tell him to brush his teeth before napping... twice.","3236":"Come on let's dance... aw yeah don't be afraid.","3237":"I think people should try to ignore their race, and just treat each other as equals.","3238":"Will you stay by my side? Will you watch as we uncover a harsh truth that was meant to remain buried, and share in the pain that comes with the act?","3239":"If you guys weren't here, I don't know what would have happened to me. You can't live in this world alone, no matter how you look at it.","3240":"Love, passion, why do we get caught up by such troublesome feelings? The mind couldn't ever get things straight, and you lose control to know what is sensible. Deep down it's all so vexing.","3241":"If I really liked him I should hope for his happiness. But like you said in the car, I actually hoped they would break up.","3242":"A wound of a heart is different from a flesh wound. Unlike a flesh wound, there are no ointments to heal it, and there are times when they never heal.","3243":"Hold on. Don't go! Let's argue again. I'll bribe you with a canel\u00e9. I'll call you to kill time. I don't mind being Friend A. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please don't go...please don't leave me behind.","3244":"If you're going to hide a tree, put it in the forest.","3245":"People live in order to be satisfied. And they hope to die while still satisfied. So, not knowing how to make yourself become satisfied is very tough.","3246":"The souls that God has given us, our spirits. Our spirits, which found a way to swim through the immense network and live in the infinity of space. Is not the human body a mere shell? A form of existence all too small and weak for consciousness with such vast reach and potential.","3247":"The Commander-General's rather violent today, wouldn't you say?","3248":"Sorry, I saw an opening that just screamed 'ATTACK,' so I did, ha!","3249":"Necessary murder. Man must kill to live. That hasn't changed, even with humanity's decline. The situation has reached the point in which escape and refusal are no longer options, so I must act.","3250":"Our bodies get bigger, but our hearts get torn up.","3251":"Well, dying for honor isn't such a bad thing. Because it's hard to survive and live in misery.","3252":"If someone lives, they will surely die. That is the absolute rule of this world.","3253":"The people who have the ability to change something in this world, all, without exception, have guts to abandon things important to them if they have to.","3254":"Raise your head, Wabisuke.","3255":"I make my own decisions, and see them to the very end. I had to find my resolve, so I could remain true to myself.","3256":"Only two kinds of people exist in this world, those who steal and those who are stolen from.","3257":"Emiya Shirou! Listen, you are not \"one who fights\". You are nothing more than \"one who creates\". Don't think of irrelevant things. There is only one thing you can do, master that one thing. Do not forget. The thing you image is always \"your strongest self.\" You don't need any other enemies. The opponent you have to fight is none other than \"your own image\".","3258":"Are you telling me to go back and put a corpse on trial?","3259":"I always hated the fact that I was never blessed with any magic. But in place of that, I was blessed with wonderful teammates.","3260":"Forgive my rudeness, but to hide your true self and make a vain display... I think that's just running away from reality. To know what you are really like, and acknowledge it... A positive thinking of enjoying yourself... isn't that what true strength is?","3261":"(To Sensui) Here's a one way ticket straight to Hell! YOU BASTAARD!","3262":"You know, when I was in high school, I was a troublemaker. I hardly went to school. Before I knew it, I was expelled. When I couldn't go anymore, was when I first realized, that school was a great thing. There's a lot of friends and lots of fun things. When I got this old, I wanted even more to go to school. That's why I became a teacher. Because, if I become a teacher, I could stay in school until I die, right? That's why I'm really happy now. I want you to be like that too. I want you to like school. Once it's over, it's too late.","3263":"Is he living his dreams in death? Or.. is death the end of dreams?","3264":"Power rules the Heavens just as Power rules in the Lower world.","3265":"A lot of the times, you're going into a situation you know nothing about. So what you need is to be quick to act... and make tough decisions in worst-case scenarios.","3266":"Sometimes you have to fight for the things that are worth fighting for.","3267":"[to Hisagi after stabbing him] I am afraid. Then and now, my fear has always been that I would die a shinigami like you.","3268":"Don't you think forcing people to help with something pointless is far more cruel?","3269":"Everyone has an ability. And it means that everyone should use that ability to the fullest.","3270":"Reflecting upon death, one appreciates life. If that\u2019s the case, does it take a mistake for people to choose the right path? Behold the brilliance of the heavens burdened with sin.","3271":"Sasuke, I always knew you were alone. In the beginning I was glad because I thought you were like me - I wanted to talk to you! But you... didn't speak. You always had everyone watching you. You could do everything and we were too different. So I decided that you would become my rival. I didn't want to lose because I was called a loser all the time. Even when we became Team 7, I still thought this way. I always tried to lie but... but the truth is... I always wanted to be like you. I aspired to be like you. Because of that... I was glad that you wanted to fight me.","3272":"A prison, you say? You think you'll be free if you go to the world above? A girl like you can never be free no matter where you go. After all, we humans are apes put in a cage called Earth. There is no difference between the world above and the world below. The only difference is which is bigger or smaller. People who pout about how confining the cage is can never be happy. They live their lives only seeing the iron bars. A true lack of freedom is when you cage your soul.","3273":"Never once did I say it.  But just as he knew my feelings and couldn't return them. She will probably realize his and probably his heart wouldn't have a chance either? When I think about things like that, my tears won't stop.","3274":"The difference in ability... What about it? Do you think I should give up just because you're stronger than me?","3275":"After everything I've faced.... Having a future with you snatched away from me ...is definitely the most terrifying thing I've ever had to endure....","3276":"A person can change, at the moment when the person wishes to change.","3277":"Even if all the confidence and pride you've built over the years is blown to pieces by a major failure, even if you've had a soul-crushing experience, you still have to open the shop the next day. That's who chefs are.","3278":"I don't have have much time. It's not that I'm busy, but I'm only willing to give you about two and a half more minutes of my life!","3279":"I just really don't wanna meet a disappointing end, with someone burning my bones without even knowing who they belonged to.","3280":"No matter how many people, you may lose, you have no choice but to go on living. No matter how devastating, the blows maybe.","3281":"Seeing them as the same is wrong. It's a touchy subject, but the weight of something you bear with your own power and with someone else's are different.","3282":"It feels like time is passing so quickly. Damn you, Einstein! Your science is crowding in on our kiss! He was right. The passage of time depends entirely on where you're standing. Relativity Theory... it's so romantic. But it's just so tragic too.","3283":"Is dying that scary to you?","3284":"Shining brightly even for a split second is better than living a dull-grey life for eternity.","3285":"I might be the ugly duckling of the group, but I'll make sure that I'll protect all of you with all my might.","3286":"It's my belief that powers aren't meant to hurt people. Nor are they meant to make others happy.","3287":"The human heart is the source of all our power... We fight with the power of our hearts.","3288":"Dreams start by believing.","3289":"No matter how much this world may change, I shall always remain myself.","3290":"Even if the truth is as one suspects, it may still be worthless.","3291":"Kakarot\u2026 please\u2026 destroy Frieza\u2026 He made me what I am. Don\u2019t\u2026 let him\u2026 do it\u2026 to anyone else. Whatever it take\u2026 Stop him\u2026 Please.","3292":"I don't want to be anyone's burden. I don't want you to be my dad if it's going to hurt you. (thinking about Kazuma)","3293":"You do them one favor and they think you're their best friend. This is why I could care less if their entire species was swallowed up.","3294":"No one would intentionally set an easily accessible place as their goal. It's a challenge, because it's difficult. It is a dream because it can't be achieved easily.","3295":"Humility is a virtue, but do not insult yourself.","3296":"My legend dates back to the 12th Century thank you very much.","3297":"I knew this was a losing battle. Even though the outcome was obvious, I still wanted to bet on that one millimeter of a possibility.","3298":"Justice cannot save the world. It is useless.","3299":"Even if no one in the world believes you, stick out your chest and scream in defiance.","3300":"People who neglect to make efforts or who don't take any actions at all are always the ones who dream that someday they will suddenly become wildly successful.","3301":"If you don't get accepted by anyone, does that mean there's no significance for you to live on?","3302":"I called you an idiot, idiot!","3303":"*referring to Haruhi* She must have been born dumb.","3304":"Everyone has their own talents, and strong wills that won't lose to anyone else.","3305":"Without strength, you won't be able to save anyone.","3306":"My eyes can see the death of everything. I can cut the lines as long as I understand the death behind it. This means I can kill anything, even if that thing is God.","3307":"Why do you have to pay money to eat?! Can't we all just share?! Where is freedom in the world?! All are slaves to labor!! The rich grow fat... While the poor die!!","3308":"If you love someone, they could make you sad. They could even make you feel lonely sometimes. But, that someone can also make you happier than you'll ever be.","3309":"A man who cannot play by himself, cannot improve by himself.","3310":"It's okay to live, even if there's no greater point to living.","3311":"It doesn't seem right to let a girl choose me. I would rather choose the girl I devote myself to.","3312":"If you throw your life away, you won't even have the capacity to feel regret.","3313":"Without what you call absolute power, we'll be able to live free and strong... That's why I have to end this. Humans often betray, fight and do terrible things to each other, but if I can feel this heat and this pain in my heart, a future where everyone will be kind to each other will definitely come some day. I can believe in it now!","3314":"One can evoke \"extraordinary\" abilities if one focuses all energy on just one point.","3315":"The right to choose life or death lies with the victor. And the victor of this battle is me.","3316":"Life comes at a cost. Wouldn\u2019t it be arrogant to die before you\u2019ve repaid that debt?","3317":"I can always tell when you\u2019re lying. I also know that you cannot tell me why you do so. So there is no need to convince me, or wrap everything in lies, or try to take the blame on yourself like that. Because I have complete faith in you, Subaru-kun.","3318":"You should quake in fear of your impending death.","3319":"I hate the fox, but the boy - I don't hate the boy.","3320":"Stop laughing hamster legs!","3321":"For me, apples are like cigarettes and liquor for humans. If I'm deprived, I go into withdrawals.","3322":"The sea\u2019s blue reflects because of the sky\u2019s blue. Just like detectives and thieves. We\u2019re all toying with the human mind. But the one who pries for others\u2019 secrets is the one who\u2019s truly impolite.","3323":"Hey, I'll have you know that I almost really did kick the bucket during that training, so don't you dare sum it all up in one word, even if it is a nice one like \"potential\".","3324":"You can make a rain of 1,000 needles. I will make it rain blood.","3325":"How long are you gonna sit in front of me sobbing your little eyes out?! It's depressing! (To Tohru)","3326":"People who can see get to choose... if you want them to know you can see. To pretend to be able to see, even when you can't... Or to pretend that you can't see even when you can.","3327":"Live on and endure the shadows! There is no light for those who do not know darkness.","3328":"You can play any character and yet in the end, you yourself are nobody. Your core personality is null. It's empty. That's how you could wear any mask all over your smooth, featureless face and have it fit perfectly.","3329":"I have to be her place to belong. I need to be a steady, reliable man whom she can trust.","3330":"The reason doesn't matter. As long as tiny bit of hope exists, that's all that matters.","3331":"I love adventures.","3332":"When I look up, I see a gloomy, cloudy sky. Today is another tiring uphill climb. I get sick of it all. Then... I think of the girl I love, and I put back on those worn down shoes. Her smile is like a ray of light that shines down from in between the clouds and warms up my heart. My girl has the smile of an angel.","3333":"[about Verde] His head is a bit off and he's a pervert scientist.","3334":"We're all born with selfish desires so we can relate to those feelings in others. But kindness is created individually by each person... So it's easy to misunderstand when someone is trying to be kind to you... But, Tohru, people's differences are something to celebrate.","3335":"Living is anxiety and pain. It's continuing to think, continuing to choose.","3336":"Every time you hurt others, you're the one who end up being hurt.","3337":"What good is this cursed hand if I can't protect the woman I love?","3338":"There's no use in just creating \"Love\". Empty hearts filled with \"Love\" tend to be unstable.","3339":"If you have no money, I believe all you can do is work.","3340":"Heroes might be lonely, but they aren't fighting alone.","3341":"Sometimes life is like jazz, and goes in an unexpected direction...","3342":"Hey sis, I've been wondering. How come everyone always closes their eyes when they sneeze? Is it to keep their eyes from popping out of their heads?","3343":"No one knows what the right decision, to make in life, is, and that is not why I made this choice.","3344":"I love this game that people call \"life\" from the bottom of my heart.","3345":"Never look at your life as something insignificant. Never forget those friends of yours that you loved.","3346":"Shut up you! What's with that TV drama attitude?!","3347":"Sorry. I don't believe in fate. I explore my future with my own strength. Good or bad, it's my own choice.","3348":"AHA-HA-HA! Alchemists are scientists. We don't believe in unprovable concepts like \"God\". *Rose looks angry* We strive to uncover the principles of creation in the matter of the world, to pursue truth... *gazes at Leto statue* it's ironic that we scientists... who don't believe in God... are in a sense the closest things to him.","3349":"What the hell was that? All my punches were solid, but he brushed them aside like broccoli he didn't order! Didn't even give me a chance to kick his ass!","3350":"Life is like a pencil that will surely run out, but will leave the beautiful writing of life.","3351":"Forcing their interest on someone else, that's a legitimate previlege of an otaku.","3352":"There is no right answer for getting along. Different people require different answers.","3353":"When things change, isn't it better to get used to the new situation quickly? If that's the case, it's better to know what you have to do. Rejecting everything and doing things half-heartedly won't make it any easier. Hanging onto your pride will only weigh you down. So, to make life easier, sometimes it's best to go along with what other people want. As I said, it's just like the old saying: \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\". Instead of others forcing it upon you, it's easier for you to want to do it yourself, right? You should try it, Mikoto. You'll be happier.","3354":"I want you to please understand the scales of my heart will always be swaying back and forth. But there is something you should know. I will never lean to one side or the other due to the weight of gold coins.","3355":"Denying possibility is denying thought.","3356":"Remember this... no matter where you go, the strength of your mind and spirit is the most powerful magic of all.","3357":"I know, someone like me can't just go out and change the world on a whim.","3358":"My abusive language is alchemized through 40 kg copper, 25 kg of zinc, 15 kg of nickel, 5 kg of ice that keeps my cool, and 97 kg of spite.","3359":"As it turns out, living was a punishment. I've been punished in small doses, living as a Takakura. But, still, we were together. We took all the punishments, no matter how small and trivial. They're all precious memories. Because the only reason I felt alive was because you two were there.","3360":"You should cry while you still can. When you get bigger, sometimes, you can't cry even if you have something you wanna cry about.","3361":"When you talk properly, you get your feelings across properly, right?","3362":"Sooo... Korra. There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym... just you and me... TWO, alone people. Together. Alone.","3363":"I wonder how long... How long will I remain anchored at this harbor known as battle?","3364":"Don\u2019t ever give up. Even if it\u2019s painful, even if it\u2019s agonizing, don\u2019t try to take the easy way out.","3365":"Pain, suffering, sadness... We all accept it, and that's why we can move forward!","3366":"You've just gained the privilege to kill.","3367":"Kurama, there is no person who does not carry scars upon their heart, and if there were such a man, they would be a shallow soul.","3368":"Those who make mistakes blame themselves and close their hearts. It's impossible to fix the mistake. Men can't return to the past. That's why they drink. Lushes, drunks, sliding alcohol down their throats to try to dilute the memories that can't be forgotten. Frank Marlon, the gunsmith, does nothing but drink, and questions the glass after it's empty. \"Am I wrong? Was I wrong?\"","3369":"Human potential for evolution is limitless.","3370":"Your sudden smiles always surprise me. But are dangerous enough to make my heart race.","3371":"Still I've never thought of myself as an unfortunate person. Of course I am not a fortunate person either. In the first place a fortunate person could never write plays or novels. I write while loving my misfortune almost as if I'm tasting it.","3372":"This world is mine. I think this world may even just be a long, long dream I'm watching. You guys may just be illusions, and it can't be proven whether or not you really exist either. In other words, this world was created with me at the center. So what will happen if I die? I don't know. My imagination isn't very creative; I just can't imagine myself dying. In other words, there is no way this world can completely disappear. But if I die, then everyone will disappear. I am the only one in this world who won't disappear. The rest are just people I see as if in a dream.","3373":"If you have the will to follow through with your beliefs, the results will follow naturally.","3374":"The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them. I lie here. I listen to the pain of the forest and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest and dream of the day when I will finally crunch that gun woman's head in my jaws... She is my daughter. One of the wolf tribe. When the forest dies, so does she. I caught her human parents defiling my forest. They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away. Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own. Now my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf.","3375":"Maybe I'm not perfect. Maybe I have a long way to go. But someday... someday I'll be able to stand and walk on my own. Without hurting anyone... and without being a burden. (to Kazuma)","3376":"There're a lot of people who want to be in despair just so they can pity themselves... But I think it's a waste of time, that's all. After all, you're the one who wishes to be left alone and refuses to share your pain with anyone else.","3377":"There are times when you can\u2019t give up.","3378":"The curtain that falls down at the end, shall be pulled down by the blade of my sword.","3379":"Re-explaining my memories through words made good memories easier to savor, and bad memories easier to accept.","3380":"Then let me ask you, if your God would allow my madness to flourish across the globe, then wouldn't it seem to you that any god like that would be just as mad as I?","3381":"Let me ask you. Does a machine like yourself ever experience fear?","3382":"A politician in the past once said: \"My secretaries did it all.\"","3383":"I just want to relieve my sexual frustrations. All I feel towards a cat eared high school girl in her underwear... is lust.","3384":"The crowd of people looks just like pixels in a picture to me. A single pixel is meaningless. But add two, three and four... They pile up rapidly until they ultimately form a picture. But I've never seen that picture.","3385":"Sometimes you have days like this. Days where the most trivial little thing... Ends up getting you wrapped up in some big, annoying trouble.","3386":"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and for thy possession, the ends of the earth. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron. Thou shalt dash them in pieces, like a potters vessel. Be wise now, therefore ye kings. Be admonished ye judges of the earth. Serve the lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, though his wrath be kindled but a little.","3387":"Pawns? Isn't that such an ugly term to use? We should call them the foundation for our futures. But it's a fact that they'll be sacrificed.","3388":"But the truth is merely the majority of the living. It only revolves around their choices and actions and nothing more.","3389":"I think society where people prefer earning to spending is a healthier one.","3390":"If it's the army's job to end a war, it's the king's job to find a place for it to end.","3391":"At times like these, you shouldn't depend on people's advice, but think about it thoroughly by yourself and make a decision. Because there's no right answer when it comes to love. Whatever your answer is, if it's your own choice, then it's right.","3392":"You know, in the end, people come home to the people they love most.","3393":"It's fine, I'll come to save you as much as you want. I'll make you fall for me as much as you wish. Leave this to your master.","3394":"But I wasn't slacking at all. I practiced till I passed out. I gave my all. And if I still turned in a sloppy performance after all that, then... That's who I am now. It's the current me, playing with everything I've got.","3395":"Tornado Flip!","3396":"If the only way to be granted life in this world is to surrender my body and soul to insanity, then I shall choose to meet my doom!","3397":"Even if you want to tell him and want to be with him, sometimes, that's not enough.","3398":"Inuyasha, you and I were fated to never meet again.","3399":"I wanted to know why was the world so twisted? Where did this twistedness come from? How can people be so wicked without needing to be? And why don't they realize their wickedness? Why are there things that bring chaos to so many lives? Why do people rule and let themselves be ruled? And why do they hurt each other? And why despite all that do people still want to live their lives? I was just looking for answers. I thought that if I met with you, you'd give me those answers... because you're looking for the same thing along a different path from mine - from the path where people can understand each other.","3400":"It's easy to say \"choose so that you'll have no regrets,\" but that's impossible. No matter how hard you've agonized over your path, you'll always regret something about it later. That's just how we humans are made. Which is why I think our true feelings are important. If you choose your path based on your true feelings, it'll hurt just a little less when you feel the same regret, right?","3401":"Just like humans, approve killing animals in society, we, approve the killing of humans.","3402":"Detective, don't waste your time trying to change their minds. Fight by their meaningless rules and you'll be pulled down with them. There's only one real law of the dark tournament: the strongest man prevails. I've retrieved enough energy to rip my way out, let's show this entire stadium a new definition for victory!","3403":"I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that. It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. ALMOST.","3404":"It just so happens that I was caught in a web. A web known as malice. Whether you put up with it, or put up a fight, it makes no difference. In the end, you get killed. If you don't like that... risk your life... and retaliate.","3405":"But you know the saying, \"play with fire, and you'll get burned\". I'll make you regret underestimating L...underestimating me.","3406":"In some ways, the more one thinks, the closer one feels to getting the answer...but in the end, it's hard to tell what is really the safe answer. I started to dislike being like that at one point, and my motto is, \"make quick decisions and act fast.\" I choose the first answer that feels \"right\" to me.","3407":"If you don't protect that child, I will never forgive you! (referring to Tohru as she was talking to Kyo on the day of the accident)","3408":"Duh!! There's no such thing as free wish.","3409":"When a girl calls someone a \"nice guy\", it means she couldn't care less about him.","3410":"If there's something you want to go through with, you should stick to it without keeping up appearances.","3411":"No one dies alone. When someone dies, the part of them that lives inside someone else also dies. You already live inside me.","3412":"We ran through our school that was filled with noises, screams, life and death.","3413":"Nothing can suppress a human\u2019s curiosity.","3414":"After all cool men don't cheat on their partners, do they?","3415":"It's like that myth about the hero... He made wings out of wax so he could fly... but when he got too close to the sun... to God... the wax melted and he crashed to the ground...","3416":"There's no advantage to hurrying through life.","3417":"When extremes are reached, evil turns to virtue.","3418":"*after Joey offers him to duel* No thanks, I think I'll have much more of a challenge playing solitaire.","3419":"If I can't even manage a polite smile, I'll be in trouble in the real world.","3420":"They often say that humans can't live alone. But you can live pretty long by yourself. Instead of feeling alone in a group, it's better to be alone in your solitude.","3421":"I'm scared of everyone. I need to learn to deal with people better.","3422":"Yeah it's going to be freaking awesome!","3423":"\u201cExpectations\u201d are what you have when you have given up. Expectations are born from a despairingly large difference in skill.","3424":"There's no need to pretend to be cool. Let's show our lame sides. That's who we really are, after all.","3425":"Identity? What? The people who yap about identities all the time are usually the ones with no identity. Like something that changes so easily could really be an \"identity\", anyway.","3426":"Prophecies don't ever come true.","3427":"Why shouldn't you quit, if that's what you really want to do? Everything will work out somehow.","3428":"Impossible, right? Compared to the enemy we're facing, you and I are the same, no more than dots! What's the point in comparing our heights? That is what makes this exciting! The smallest, the weakest - it doesn't matter! I should still wish to go and take over the world, with nothing more than my tiny dot of a body! Within my chest, beats the heart of the King of Conquerors!","3429":"Some memories... aren't meant to leave traces.","3430":"I\u2019ll promise you one thing: you two will never be in danger again.","3431":"We didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it. You're the most loyal, brave and selfless person I've ever known.","3432":"What does it mean to be a winner? Is it the last one standing? It means to climb over a mountain of corpses to get to the top. By no means is it a glorious sight to behold, in fact, it is extremely cruel. Even so, if you still wish to seek victory... then you must become a devil.","3433":"This is called the \"Rippling Sword\". \"Rippling Ophelia\"... Great name, don't you think? But it's not too well known yet. Because most of the people who've seen it are dead.","3434":"\"Never trust anyone too much... Remember the devil was once an angel...\"","3435":"I hate all these damn rich people.","3436":"Humans continue to live in a cycle of death and destruction. Guns can't change anything. It merely creates an infinite chain of hatred and retribution.","3437":"This silence belongs to us... and every single person out there, is waiting for us to fill it with something.","3438":"You've finally realized that the one thing you want, something greater than money, it can never be yours.","3439":"Walking along the path that she chose, without being affected by others... in this sense, white is her color...in another sense, it also makes me want to put more colors on her.","3440":"Stories where love and courage win in the end always turn out like that, you know? When I think about it, I became a magical girl because I always loved those stories.","3441":"Nothing that happens is ever forgotten, even if you can't remember it.","3442":"Ancient creatures died and left naught but fossil fuels, like coal and petroleum. Without that sacrifice, our present energy civilization would not exist. That sort of sacrifice is what is always demanded.","3443":"It\u2019s only natural for demons to defeat Humans.","3444":"Hey bitch, get off me! I'm supposed to be on top!","3445":"The Kuchiki clan is one of the four noble houses. We must set the standard for all shinigami. If we do not abide by the code...then who will uphold it?","3446":"It's pointless to force people to do their best if they don't want to.","3447":"Words alone, can make an entire army withdraw.","3448":"Remember that a sword held by someone who is about to die\u2026 will never be able to protect anything.","3449":"If you lose something big, that nothing can replace it... Then it\u2019s okay if you have more than one, right? Even if the number is small, whether it\u2019s 10 or 100, if you gather them up then you will have a reason to go on!","3450":"The root of all your evil is in always relying on one of your other possibilities to get your wish. You must accept that you are the person here, now, and that you cannot become anyone else other than that person.","3451":"*on the phone* I'm sorry to interrupt you, Major, but let me offer a bit of feminine advice. BABIES AREN'T BORN AFTER JUST FIVE MONTHS!","3452":"No matter what may happen... As long as you walk by my side... There shall be no enemy that can stand before us.","3453":"Providence may guide a man to meet one specific person, even if such guidance eventually leads him to darkness. Man simply cannot forsake the beauty of his own chosen path. When will man learn a way to control his soul?","3454":"(referring to the letter for Kisa from the teacher) Here. It says to \"like yourself\". But good things about yourself... how are you supposed to find them? I only know things I hate about myself. 'Cause that's all I know, I hate myself. But even if you force yourself to find good things... it feels so empty. It doesn't work that way. People like your teacher just don't get it. I think... when you hear someone say they like you, for the first time... then you can begin to like yourself. I think when someone accepts you, for the first time... you feel like you can... forgive yourself a little. You can begin to face your fears... with courage.","3455":"If you're always worried about crushing the ants beneath you... you won't be able to walk.","3456":"There's no telling when this war will end. No matter how many troops the country deploys, the desert just absorbs them like water. We suffer, conquer, and what's left? Nothing but sand.","3457":"History is not merely a linear collection of points that we pass through on a timeline. They are connected by a line. No, perhaps it is more accurate to say that they are made to connect.","3458":"Check it out yo, how kick ass is my new fighter plane of doom!? Dude, it blowin your mind yet or what?","3459":"[as a child] Why should I be sad?! My parents died protecting the village from the monster fox. They're heroes, and I'm the son of those heroes! If I cry, it's because I'm happy! I'm not even sad that they went and left me all alone...","3460":"I used to think that eating was only consuming needed nutrients. I never thought it could fill the emptiness in me.","3461":"Every one of us must do what's in their power! If we're going to die anyway, then it's better to die fighting than to do nothing!","3462":"Learning and copying are the same.  Everyone starts out copying someone else. Every last person.","3463":"You really don't know what happened, do you? It doesn't matter. By all means, stay in this cozy coffin of yours and continue to play prince. But I have to go now. She's not gone at all, she merely vanished form your world. Farewell.","3464":"[sarcastically] In my country, we exchange a pleasant \"hello\" before asking questions.","3465":"Look what I found! These are packue berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant... THAT, or makaoli berries that cause blindness.","3466":"In that case, you have nothing to fear. Mistakes aren\u2019t made by locking your feelings away and holding back\u2026 They\u2019re made while wearing your heart on your sleeve.","3467":"For the right price, you can buy not only treasures, but dreams, hearts and even people's lives!","3468":"From now on, Lacus Clyne will be singing the song of peace.","3469":"*to Reim* It means that you have no affinity for chains with fighting skills. You try to avoid violence even when you fight. That's a very good thing.","3470":"Not every result can be the one desired. Trust your own judgments and actions. That is enough.","3471":"Be more confident despite your weaknesses and failures.","3472":"The right thing is\u2026 to have faith in life, until you\u2019re sure of death. That\u2019s what makes a great detective.","3473":"Ciel, how are you?","3474":"Every single one of them died while furiously giving off the light that resided within them and that light is then inherited by the next person where it will go on to shine with an even greater radiance. And thus people are connected together... allowing us to work towards a better tomorrow.","3475":"Human memories aren't reliable. Your brain will add something or just glorify it, memories make you believe what happened was better than it actually was.","3476":"When we first met, you set my heart ablaze. When I see you, all I can do is gaze. Gaze at the beauty and wonder that is you. The constellation Gemini will make me think of me and you. You are my Yami and I am your Hikari. I love you, my Yami. Now and forever.","3477":"In order to save a life, you must throw another life away.","3478":"Who cares about school?! The real me lives on the Internet!","3479":"Glad you're okay *wink* I kinda like you.","3480":"Exams are an opportunity to teach correctly the meaning of winning and losing, of strong and weak. Students soak up heaping helpings of successes and setbacks! Take in now what it means to win, what it means to lose!","3481":"I'll help you... But not by death, this world has enough of that. You can keep your life as long as you change the way you live it. It's never too late, believe me.","3482":"I was too bent on fulfilling my objectives\u2026 I failed to see things from a larger perspective. I failed to build up a good relationship with them.","3483":"Why should I apologize for being a monster? Has anyone ever apologized for turning me into one?","3484":"[as a child, to Rangiku Matsumoto] I've decided. I'm going to become a Shinigami. Become a Shinigami and change things. So that they'll end...without Rangiku having to cry.","3485":"Ashitaka... can you save the girl you love?","3486":"Maybe everything you wish for won't become stars, but if you have a dream to believe in, they'll be thousands of the most glittering jewels in the night sky.","3487":"You see, the world will not change through naive talks.","3488":"If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, wouldn't I be betraying him?","3489":"Willpower alone isn\u2019t enough in battle.","3490":"I'd better split before I catch loser-itis!","3491":"All the more reason to dissect one, before the whole species dies off.","3492":"I am looking at things from a much higher perspective than you. I observe this world, this universe, the truth of all things. And I have come to realize that humanity must be destroyed. Out of all which the Gods have made, humans are their sole failure. They are a disease that must be vanquished. A filth that must be cleansed. They have no place here, in this universe, and if I am to make it a utopia once more, then I must take upon the grand task of removing humanity forever, in place of the Gods who refuse to admit their mistake.","3493":"For you I will go deeper than mountains, and higher than sea.","3494":"Today, everything's shining brightly! The air, the people, and even this classroom; because today, I actually did my homework!","3495":"The moment you find the courage to give up your life for someone, would be the moment you understand love.","3496":"Understanding 100% of everything is impossible. That's why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. That's what makes life so interesting.","3497":"Most people are irresponsible, changing their opinions easily based on unconfirmed information or convenient rumors.","3498":"Getting dumped always makes a man stronger. But then again, men aren't meant to pursue happiness.","3499":"There are times when working hard may not be enough. But those who succeed worked hard.","3500":"Just because someone is important to you, it doesn't necessarily mean that, that person is good. Even if you knew that person was evil... People cannot win against their loneliness.","3501":"Dedication is a talent all on its own.","3502":"There are two types of lies: Lies that hurt, and lies that don't hurt.","3503":"It seems that you still want to dance but... You will not be able to make steps anymore.","3504":"Noblesse oblige. You have the power but not using that power is a sin.","3505":"You ain't gonna know unless you climb up yerself. Ain't no way to look if you don't try.","3506":"If we only focus on making the best moves, we will never get the better of our opponent. When necessary, we must be willing to take big risks, and be prepared to lose everything. Unless we change how we fight, we cannot win.","3507":"Humpty Dumpty. I reject you.","3508":"Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name, the Fancy Dancer?","3509":"Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They're my friends.","3510":"If you're felling like there's nowhere you belong... That you're trapped in a small world. It's those feelings that drive us beyond our world.","3511":"I'll never show you my tears. These are the tears of those who died with regrets. If there's a way to take away these regrets, I'll make sure I'll find it. If it's fear that you speak of, then I'll stand and face it. I'll never give up. The only time I lose is when I die!","3512":"The real me is super cool!","3513":"Let me ask you the reverse. How is it that you can give up so easily? [exaggerated sigh] I can't understand that\u2026attitude! \u201cIt's bad luck! I have no choice!\u201d People who passively accept their fate\u2026because no one knows their future, least of all me, so I don't dare put things off. I have to do what I can, while I can still do it, so\u2026I'll be kicking and screaming, 'til the very end.","3514":"The first one to move wins. Stay on the defensive and you'll lose your chance.","3515":"I'm going to keep getting closer and closer to you. And not just day after day, oh no. It's going to happen much faster than that! See I'm already closer to you than I was a moment ago. And I'll keep getting closer and closer to you, until I swallow you up and then, you'll disappear. Things are not turning out well for you at all, are they? (laughs) See you around.","3516":"Wrong, holy man. All we want is to get our bodies normal again. See, we don't lie about what's possible. We didn't start a cult.","3517":"People who can\u2019t throw something important away, can never hope to change anything.","3518":"There are no inherently bad people. Everyone believes that, myself included. I don\u2019t doubt the existence of virtue. And yet people bare their fangs when it seems they can profit. People will rationalize their own behavior whenever they become tainted with evil; they\u2019re not supposed to be evil. In order to preserve their own twisted integrity, the world becomes twisted. \nSomeone you praised as \u201ccool\u201d until yesterday is \u201cstuck up\u201d today; someone you respected as \u201csmart and knowledgeable\u201d is now scorned as someone who \u201clooks down on bad students\u201d, and \u201cenergetic vigor\u201d becomes \u201cannoying and overly carried away\u201d.","3519":"Whenever I see tulips, I'm always reminded of when we learned that these precious little flowers, have the strength to endure harsh winters.","3520":"[In his Resurrecci\u00f3n form] I can see! I can see! I can see!!! So this is the sky!! So this is blood!! So this is the world!! ...So this is what you look like. Komamura. You are uglier... than I thought.","3521":"The person you like the most, likes you back the most. It seems so simple. But why is it? It feels like it will never come together...forever like this...","3522":"Even I... know what it's like to be jealous.","3523":"If I'm not at my limit, means I'm not trying as hard as I can!","3524":"Now all that is left is the destruction of earth, but I think it would be a waste to destroy it. The food of this planet is very delicious.","3525":"Why are you acting like you're the only one hurting when you pushed him away?","3526":"I'll ward off the water from above, can you handle the water on the ground? We'll work together, it's a good thing there are two of us here. This plan would be impossible alone. Quite an obstacle.","3527":"Damn that sister of mine! She's always talking about our father, but what did that baldy ever do for us?! He just played Othello with us from time to time!","3528":"Even if I\u2019m not perfect\u2026 Even if I\u2019m not the ideal me\u2026 He says that I\u2019m still my own person.\nThe point of life isn\u2019t to be perfect.\nIt\u2019s to do want you want to do, to be who you want to be.\nThat\u2019s how I should be trying to live.","3529":"Kindness can sometime translate to hostility.","3530":"Being the best decoy ever is as cool as being the ace.","3531":"It's not justice if you don't go overboard.","3532":"If it\u2019s an important memory, then you shouldn't forget it. Since those who aren't with us only live on in our memories.","3533":"I could say I'm not sad, but I'd be lying. The problem is the world won't let me stay a kid forever, so I can't lie around crying about it either.","3534":"A name has nothing to do with loving someone.","3535":"Love and the human mind can't be analyzed with formulas. It's not so unusual for love to make you forget the sense of care and respect for others. There's no logic. It's an uncontrollable urge. To tell you the truth, it\u2019d be worrisome if you became like that. Your mind is keen, and your character is good. But passion has nothing to do with mind or character.","3536":"I knew that it was pointless to hope for anything. I was so apathetic because of this sort of upbringing.","3537":"I've already made up my mind, to the statement: \"The most important thing in life is money\". I answered \"No\".","3538":"I'm not short! I'm fun-sized!","3539":"Break them and they're all just trash.","3540":"Don't go thinking that there's a world where it's natural to be happy! Even if you start complaining, nothing will change! You need to make things fun by yourself!","3541":"The beginning of a story is a sudden event; the start, a happy accident, the end, the fate for which it's meant. A story that never ends is a sad fate.","3542":"Whether fairies have tails or not, or whether they even exist, nobody knows for sure. So it's like an eternal mystery, an eternal adventure.","3543":"The final curtain falls at the very moment a person gives up.","3544":"At first, people only play as dots. But when lines of trust and friendship connect those dots, the lines become a circle and that circle is teamwork. As long as you keep playing as a dot, the others won't trust you either.","3545":"I won the battle but lost the war!","3546":"What is really wicked... is judging people without even trying to get to know them!","3547":"Just because my reasoning is childish and wrong, and just because my argument can be easily defeated with a bit of cleverness, does not mean your reasoning is completely correct.","3548":"Happiness is hot chocolate on a cold day.","3549":"A picture of you sleeping with a stupid look on your face totally oblivious to the dangers of this trip serves as a warning to future generations!","3550":"I'm not asking you to love me. No, actually, please don't love me. But please let me be in love with you.","3551":"Everything in this world is just a game and we are merely the pawns.","3552":"Hmm... never noticed those before *after accidently groping Momiji's chest*.","3553":"Doesn't seem to matter how far I travel, my destiny is always followed by blood and gunsmoke. The result is always the same every time, mountains of death and debris.","3554":"I am Justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil. I'm the one that will become the god of a new world that every one desires!","3555":"Be proud as someone who, after being struck by this power, is still able to retain the shape of a body.","3556":"But I suppose it\u2019s not so bad that an old friend is the same as ever.","3557":"I never like to work based on trust. It takes hard work to build up trust, but only an instant to lose it. There's no less profitable investment.","3558":"If we make it back to the real world, I'll find you. And fall in love with you all over again.","3559":"One cannot live by jokes alone. But if there were no jokes, I\u2019d rather not live.","3560":"Even if they're not your own child, you can't, as an adult, overlook their wrongdoings.","3561":"Kira is a god.","3562":"Don\u2019t wimp out! Save him! Save him! Save him! Im not powerless anymore! Move!!","3563":"Eat Harkonnen, bitch!","3564":"Missy, could you please lend me your underwear?","3565":"To ask is a moment's shame. Not to, lifelong.","3566":"I hate waiting, but if waiting means being able to be with you I'll wait for as long as forever.","3567":"I had no intention of deceiving anyone. It's just that none of you could understand...My true self.","3568":"Life is like a playground swing, the higher and farther forward you go as you swing, it carries the risk of falling just as far back.","3569":"Ephemeral and brilliant one, fall to my embrace. That is my decision.","3570":"(singing) A tisket, a tasket, a pokemon egg basket!","3571":"You can't see the whole picture until you look at it from the outside.","3572":"In the battlefield, there is no place for hope. What lies there is only cold despair and a sin called victory, built on the pain of the defeated. All those people who met there have wholeheartedly admitted the evil and foolishness of this act called war. As long as people don't repent and don't regard it as the most evil taboo, then hell will endlessly reappear in the world.","3573":"If your face gets any closer, someone who isn't supposed to be in this scene is going to come over there and kick your ass!","3574":"I really hate violence ...\n\nI just want to get stronger, \nstrong enough so that someday \nI can contain my anger!","3575":"You\u2019re the only one that can save my sister.","3576":"It is foolish to listen to one who will not listen to you. Do as you wish.","3577":"There is something mysterious about the life of a pirate.","3578":"Nothing you or your friends say will affect my life in any way, shape, or form.","3579":"A brat who is afraid to be hurt isn't qualified to love someone.","3580":"[naked and smiling at Shinji] Hey Shinji, you idiot! Want to become of one mind and one body?","3581":"If things were to change, do you think you could ever fall in love with me? Or fulfill a dream for which I long? The world is about to change. That's why I'm here now. I've come and this will mean a new beginning for my life.","3582":"Food tastes best when you don't have to work for it.","3583":"Love is a magnificent thing but, incidentally, it can also give birth to dreadful tragedy.","3584":"If I have the power to make a difference, I should put it to good use.","3585":"Flowers are disturbed, god of flowers weeps, winds of Heaven are disturbed, demon of Heaven laughs. Katen Ky\u014dkotsu!","3586":"Goodbye, vice captain. Why don't you suck on some mayonnaise in the afterlife? [he shoots, blowing up the whole wall]","3587":"Our minds don't work the way we expect them to.","3588":"Breaking a bond is every bit as painful as being physically torn apart. Can you endure that?","3589":"I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries.","3590":"If I told her how I feel, she'd miss me even more. Afterall, I'm the guy who keeps breaking her heart by making her wait an eternity... even though I'm always by her side. I don't wanna see her cry anymore. Even if it means I no longer have a place in her heart. Seems pretty childish of me, doesn't it?","3591":"I want to be the only one... who can help the one I care about.","3592":"Bye-Bye now.","3593":"To ensure that all I've done won't end up a lie. I don't want to talk big game to people, then run away when it matters the most. This is a wall I must overcome on my own. If there's anything I want to change, I have to change myself. If I must become evil to defeat evil, I will become the devil himself. That's all to it.","3594":"Killed in action and promoted two ranks for it. Brigadier General Hughes. You were the guy who was supposed to work below me and to push me to the top. Then you get yourself killed and surpass me in the ranks. I don't know what's more absurd, You or the State.","3595":"A memory is something that is consciously recalled, right? That's why sometimes, it can be mistaken or wrong. It's different from a memory locked deep within your heart.","3596":"Youth is a hoax. It's evil. People who make a big deal of their \"youth\", are just inviting trouble. They try to keep everything going on around them. For them, if there's something that has to do with their \"youth\", they jump at it without a second thought. From normal daily life, to rebelling against the view of society. If you fall in with them - lies, secrets, failure, and even crimes await you. But for them, it's just a spice of life. And if failure is also a mark of \"youth\", then isn't it ironic, that a person who failed to make any friends, is also technically leading his \"youth\"? Though I wonder if they would agree. Everything runs on their schedule. Let me be clear. The people who enjoy their \"youth\", will eventually fall apart.","3597":"I think there are many things in this world we are better off not knowing. Sometimes the truth is the cruelest thing of all. Not everyone can bear it.","3598":"I\u2019m built to last I\u2019ve got plenty of energy left to spare. I\u2019m not giving up.","3599":"It's dangerous here. If you stare at the stars long enough, you start thinking you could grab one, and you get this feeling like all your dreams will come true.","3600":"It may be hard right now... But you must silence those thoughts! Stop counting only those things that you have lost! What is gone, is gone! So ask yourself this: What is there... that still remains to you?!","3601":"Thinking it's your fault after the fact is just pointless.","3602":"I'm selfish, I know. But to keep you only mine, I will do everything I needed to do, even if it's illegal.","3603":"It is a thousand years too early... for you to become worthy enough to die by my Bankai.","3604":"I'm the smartest member in the Straw Hat group.","3605":"Not taking the initiative to secure your future but just waiting for luck to come your way, wasn't that just the definition of being lazy?","3606":"I should just do what I'm able to do. No matter how small it is, there's no need to feel ashamed.","3607":"If you'll cower at the sight of the great foe before you, leave at once, coward. If you'll lose the strength you believed in, then fall to the ground, weakling.","3608":"I'm creating trouble. Can't you see?","3609":"No, I can\u2019t lose!","3610":"Applying knowledge is of the utmost importance when studying. You wrestle with various things and come up with a solution from there. It's true that asking someone who knows the answer is the quickest. But you can't necessarily say that that's the best way, don't you think?","3611":"When I began thinking of him as I fell asleep, I stopped having nightmares. I began to look forward to seeing him. For the first time since I arrived here, I was happy.","3612":"The biggest mistake in my life is that i was born!","3613":"*mockingly* That's amazing, Mikuru! We're counting on you! The Earth is in your-- *breaks into uncontrollable and hysterical laughter*","3614":"Searching for someone to blame is just a pain.","3615":"It could be real difficult to hide when you're as big a star as I am.","3616":"I always wanted to become stronger. At first it was to protect myself. Next, it was to protect Hak, who gave up everything for me. Now, it's to repay my friends, who enabled me to live.","3617":"Since when did the \"Cat\" set the rules for this house? You mean to tell me that you contribute more to this house than anyone else? Do you pay all the bills? I can't stand people who do absolutely nothing but complain all the time! (To Kyo)","3618":"I want to see and understand the world outside. I don\u2019t want to die inside these walls without knowing what\u2019s out there.","3619":"Forcing yourself to like something you don't like brings sorrow.","3620":"While we talk,  look forward to making up for all the time you've wasted looking back! We can start by talking about tomorrow. You can say anything like, whether you'll make Japanese or Western style breakfast tomorrow, or whether you'll put on your right or left shoe first. It can be something silly like that. No matter how silly it is, you can talk about tomorrow because you have a tomorrow.","3621":"We have no need for the past. All we need are the present and the future.","3622":"If you let anger and revenge consume you... You'll find yourself unable to behold the beautiful sights right before your eyes.","3623":"Lelou? I'm glad that I could talk to you in the end. You know? When I got my memories back, I was so scared... A fake teacher... Friends with no memories... Everyone was... lying to me... It was as if... the whole world was watching over me... Lelou, you've been fighting... all by yourself against this world... All by yourself... So that's why... I wanted to become the one thing truthful to you... I love you, Lelou. Even when I knew you killed my father... I couldn't... bring myself to hate you. Even when you tried to make me forget everything... I still fell... in love with you again... Even when my memories were altered... I still fell in love again... No matter how many times I'm reborn... I'm sure I'll... fall in love with you again, Lelou... This... is fate, right? So, it's okay, right, Lelou? That I fall in love with you when I'm reborn... No matter... how many times... I'll... fall in... love with you...","3624":"Gai...what I said earlier...I was out of line. I was being a self-righteous fool. I realize now that if I'd been in your shoes, I probably couldn't have stopped him, either.","3625":"Strangely enough, when you get older, the things you didn't understand when you were a child... start to make sense. \"When this happened, I should have done that.\" \"When that happened, I should have said this.\" Those types of things. You start to understand rather than regret. It may be closer to repentance. So it may be that I do want to repent and erase the ignorant self from my childhood. Maybe that's what they mean when they say adults are selfish.","3626":"All people have sanctuary which mustn't be touched. A scar of sadness which mustn't be entered. The living confront each other to achieve their ideals. In a quiet voice, the man in the white coat told me... that he had finally found me, that he wanted my life. That man smiled a smile deeper than darkness. Legato Bluesummers, a man fascinated by Death...","3627":"Even a dim star is sending light somewhere.","3628":"There were sad days, and painful ones and there may be more. Even so they're treasured days that I'll never forget.","3629":"If you were to be troubled over something as trivial as losing face, then it's better to not have it at all.","3630":"Sinful? Corrupt? I don't understand your logic. Why must pleasure and sin be connected? Pleasure gotten through evil means could be a sin. But pleasure can also result from good deeds. What kind of philosophy calls pleasure itself a sin?","3631":"Even if I could redo the past, I must not take back what has already happened, because if I do that, everything would be a lie: those tears, that pain, those memories, that cold reality that hurts my heart, all of it. There were people who died in pain. There were people who risked their lives to save others. There were people who mourned for the deaths. But then, if everything were taken back and it did not happen, where would all of those go? The dead people would not come back. Reality cannot be overturned. To continue on remembering the pain and the weight\u2026 isn't that how lost things remain? People will eventually die and death itself is sad, but pain shouldn't be the only thing that remains. A death is painful, but it also leaves behind bright memories. As I am bound by these people's deaths\u2026 As I am protected by my memories of Kiritsugu... I believe memories become constraints and change the people living now... Even if... They are memories that will eventually be forgotten.","3632":"When something dies or is lost, that thing doesn't truly disappear, as long as someone remembers it. And that remembering it is to acknowledge its existence, and because of that, it can sometimes be seen again.","3633":"I never feel more human than when I'm fighting real monsters.","3634":"Why do we have to be okay being friends with someone who won't treat us as friends?","3635":"Rejection makes a man stronger.","3636":"Everyone can make a choice after they have learned what it will result in. It is so easy to say we should have done it this way afterwards. But you can\u2019t know what your choice will result in before actually choosing.","3637":"I am the great assassin Black Star! And I've come here to assassinate you all!","3638":"A warrior would rather die, than survive defeat.","3639":"Humans who would dare to play God must pay a steep price for their arrogance, that is Truth.","3640":"There are always chances in life.","3641":"Love requires no reason. That is what makes it love!","3642":"I shall light a fire upon the fang that falls short, so that I needn't see that star...So that it shall not tear this throat of mine.","3643":"*talking about a nosebleed* And why would a girl your age pick hard enough to get a nosebleed?!","3644":"You find a glimmer of hope, only to lose it. That is when your despair tastes the most divine.","3645":"The chosen one? I feel more like the frozen one.","3646":"You are the most important person to me in the whole wide world.","3647":"There is no guarantee that your dreams are just good ones.","3648":"No matter where you go, everyone's connected.","3649":"Being rivals does not mean being an enemy.","3650":"I like myself. I have never once hated myself. My high specs, my half-decent looks, my pessimistic, realist point of view... I don't hate any of it at all.","3651":"You got away with just physical damage, but I'm going to take CRITICAL MENTAL DAMAGE!","3652":"I bet that when they run out of delicacy points, girls turn into old ladies.","3653":"I'm not fighting because I want to win. I'm fighting because I have to win.","3654":"Celebrations are more fun if there are more people.","3655":"Yeah, if I saw her smiling to herself while reading this, I might think it was creepy. But there's something wrong with people who talk trash and laugh behind another's back, too.","3656":"My own mother thought I was a monster. She was right of course... but it still hurt.","3657":"You're not supposed to find yourself, you're supposed to choose yourself!","3658":"I don't need you anymore. I'm tired of you. (To Haru)","3659":"Knowing what it feels to be in pain, is exactly why we try to be kind to others.","3660":"When you are down, how do you pick yourself up? People fall into two categories... depending on how they pick themselves up. The first one sees somebody who is worse off and thinks, \"Hey! I am better off than that guy.\" And the second kind of guy sees a challenge and tries to raise himself to it.","3661":"Death on the battlefield comes regardless of class, royal or common. The loser must die!","3662":"But there's nothing wrong about worrying. It's like a wall you need to overcome, to make it to the next level. If you're running up against that wall, it means you're moving forward. I wonder how many walls I've broken up until now, but if you won't move yourself, you will never get anywhere.","3663":"You disappointed me. So I have to give you a punishment. Regret your helplessness and feel despair.","3664":"Even in my second life, a failure is still going to be a failure.","3665":"Do you need a reason to not want to lose?","3666":"And so, the prince and the princess lived happily ever... Happily!? Happiness in stories is, at most, a trifling matter of a couple of lines at the end \u2014 the epitome of boredom. Now, show me a magnificent tragedy! A cataclysm of tears from which not one of the players is saved, and to which a happy ending never comes!","3667":"I'm an apple for a day and I need a doctor right away...","3668":"There is nothing more expensive than something free.","3669":"It\u2019s the most powerful words in the world. No just argument or eloquence can stand a chance against it. It\u2019s\u2026 \u201dSo what?\u201d","3670":"This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable. And take advantage of everything here, except me.","3671":"Why..? How can she say things like that so easily? If we hear that from our parents, what are we supposed to do? Rin thinks that she's been \"bad\". But who do you think is the one who's being \"bad\" here!?! Having people take their anger out on us, being laughed at, not being taken seriously. We kids get hurt just like you do! Why can't you understand something so simple?! Apologize! APOLOGIZE! APOLOGIZE TO RIN!! [Rin's mom shuts the door] HEY!! I TOLD YOU TO APOLOGIZE!!","3672":"You can't bring back what you've lost, think about what you have now!","3673":"I love her so much that I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.","3674":"Love in real life isn\u2019t as smooth as in manga...","3675":"What we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence.","3676":"There is great value in the time spent in ones own company, but a life time of total isolation is a fate no one should endure.","3677":"You think you're special? You're not. Everyone lies, everyone hides things... Nobody makes it through this life being completely honest.","3678":"[to Aang, who is playing around] Stop! Stop it right now! What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with the war going on.","3679":"The death of a culture, is the death of a people.","3680":"It doesn't matter who your parents were. Everyone is a child of the sea.","3681":"No matter what painful things happens, even when it looks like you'll lose... when no one else in the world believes in you... when you don't even believe in yourself... I will believe in you!","3682":"In this world, there is no such thing as \"absolute\"!","3683":"This is DUUUMMMBBB!!!!!!","3684":"The Devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.","3685":"Are you telling me to flee from my foe!? The blood of a coward doesn't flow through these veins!","3686":"It's because we don't unterstand! It's because we don't unterstand that we wonder what the other is thinking and try desperately to unterstand every word they say... You end up thinking too much about the other person, and being close to them becomes painful so you try to distance yourself... I believe you become friends with somebody by doing that over and over, and that's how... As much as I hate to admit it, it's how I became friends with these guys.","3687":"The Camellia Blossom also know as Tsubaki, is a flower without fragrance. It proclaims nothing, blooming in silence. When the blossomed pettles scatter, it's quietly tragic. I am Tsubaki. A silent flower without fragrance.","3688":"Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it tastes like sand. I never thought I would miss the taste of mud so much.","3689":"If you keep trying to reason with yourself instead of listening to your feelings, you'll never be able to feel true happiness.","3690":"I've never seen a man with a screw sticking out of his head before. I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with a guy like that!","3691":"Just because someone's friends with a nice person doesn't mean they're nice, too. \nSometimes they're friends because the person's nice enough to have them.","3692":"Three times now... We've fought world wars for our own nations, our own villages. We've hurt one another. We've hated one another. That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created ME. I was a Jinchuuriki, the embodiment of hatred and power. And I hated this world, and all the people in it... I wanted to destroy it with my own hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man, one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki... He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will! There are no enemies here because we've all suffered at Akatsuki's hand! SO THERE IS NO SAND, NO STONE, NO LEAF, NO MIST, NO CLOUD! THERE ARE ONLY SHINOBI! And if you still hold a grudge against the Sand, then when this war is over, come and take my head instead! Our enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want to protect our world! But I'm too young to protect it all on my own! All of you lend me your aid!","3693":"You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards. How pathetic. You can just sit here and suck on your fingers. Yeah, do that.","3694":"Then just become stronger. I have my ambition, you have your ambition too. Which means you should just keep walking forward towards that goal.","3695":"Anime - it's not something that can be thought of in a hall for conferences. It is made out of strange juices current from the brain of animators.","3696":"It is a sad truth that greater the authority a person possesses, the more he tends to fear change.","3697":"If this world wasn't a complete hell for me, that's because you were alive.","3698":"You can become happy right now.\" I won't say these types of absurd lies. However, if you get through these current hardships and survive - a time where you can be happy will come.","3699":"Jojo, being human means having limits. I've learned something. The more carefully you scheme, the more unexpected events come along","3700":"My goal is so far away that I'm not even on the starting line yet.","3701":"It's only the end if you give up!","3702":"Sorry I'm late guys, a black cat crossed my path so I had to go the long way.","3703":"When there's nothing to be gained, rising to the challenge at those times... is surely the mark... of a true hero!!","3704":"Hey, all it did was go around in a full circle.","3705":"I too used to believe that the world would be a better place if I hadn\u2019t been born. I was hated merely for the fact that I existed, and I died for the happiness of many people. But there was one thing I wished for with all my heart... If I\u2019m ever given a second chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish.","3706":"Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary. The huge factory that can be seen from our town, the Medical Mechanica Plant, all the adults got excited when it came here, like it was really a big thing. The white steam that blows out every day at the same time, it looked to me like smoke that signified some kind of omen. Smoke that spreads out and covers everything.","3707":"We finally became friends. I've said everything I wanted to say. Now we know everything about each other. Though, from the moment we become friends, we'll never speak to each other again.","3708":"What must triumph here is the knight's path of chivalry that we champion. Is that not so, Heroic Spirit Arturia?","3709":"All of the Arrancar follow me... because they see me as fearless and the only individual who can actually bring forth the new world... the new future where you can belong. Without me, that dream can't be fulfilled and without me the gotei 13 will destroy you all...  Do you see it now from my point of view?","3710":"For a man to stand up again, he needs one thing... \"To make excuses\".","3711":"In the human world, truth and reality aren't always one and the same. Humans just call their desires and ambitions as \"truth\". Humans will even kill other humans if they have \"truth\" as an excuse.","3712":"Any kind of life can go wrong, or sicken or suffer. Lives get old, decay, and finally die. Disliking that fact because it hurts, isn't any different than disliking life itself.","3713":"Success comes only to those who have dared to stand up without fear!","3714":"I can hardly tell anymore where the truth ends and the lies begin.","3715":"The longer one holds on to a memory, the longer one lives in the past. The deeper the memory they hold onto, the more beautiful the past will become. The beautiful memories will eventually turn into hate. Even if they look ahead, they lose the ability to walk. As long as the heavy chain called revenge continues to bind the heart, the tears of sadness will continue to flow.","3716":"Since childhood, my body was weak. There was a limit to what I could do. A weak body... A life which I don't know how long I would live for. Well, life has its limits. I felt like my limit was exceeding faster than others' limit.","3717":"Push through the pain, giving up hurts more.","3718":"Love. I myself have never loved another person.  Most likely, I don't even love myself.  I do have knowledge of it.  But I am incapable of determining whether or not it is vital in my life.","3719":"[To Yuki] Liar! Moping around like a sad rat who lost his cheese!","3720":"[as Zhao threatens the moon spirit] Whatever you do to that spirit, I'll unleash on you tenfold! Let it go now!","3721":"Who falls for who depends completely on the person. If there are a hundred people, there are a hundred ways to love... There never is one absolute form of love.","3722":"We do not live in a fairy-tale world. We cannot simply take revenge on those who have betrayed us and say \"the end\". We have to live on after this. And taking revenge for betrayal only invites more revenge.","3723":"There's a thin line between recklessness and courage.","3724":"Maybe... just maybe, the light can reach even the bottom of a dark ocean.","3725":"Even if I found happiness, my weakness can't be discarded. But, even so, I'm sure that we took the right path to move forward.","3726":"This is the world I live in. The dirty world of the adults.","3727":"People who grow up in different environments will invariably have different tastes and preferences. Therefore, could one say that the subsequent marriages necessarily lead to happiness?","3728":"*To Lambo*  Smile... I said smile! Smile! Damn you!","3729":"It's not always possible to do what we want to do, but it's important to believe in something before you actually do it.","3730":"I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.","3731":"It\u2019s natural that men have things they need to protect.","3732":"The most precious thing is different for every human. They resist and kill each other because of their difference. It has nothing to do with the inability to sense the other's most important thing.","3733":"Someone who cannot hate something, cannot love something, either.","3734":"No point in wondering who someone really is, all you can do is trust them and accept them for who they are. Because the person you come to know is who that person really is.","3735":"People do not cease to exist immediately after dying, as long as there are people who remember them.","3736":"Sometimes when I'd go to visit her in the hospital...she would purposely avoid me. Then I didn't know what she was thinking about anymore... (to Yuki, about Rin)","3737":"You're young. Time is on your side. You'll grow up and I'll grow old. Someday you'll likely beat me. It's only natural. Even the strongest man must die.","3738":"Chubbies rule!","3739":"Expecting others to read your mind is delusional. But... But... I... I...\"It's not empty words I'm after. There was something else I desired all along. Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort. I don't care about being understood. I simply wish to understand. Understand, know, and rest easy in that knowledge-- gain some peace of mind. Wanting to know people inside-out because being in the dark terrifies me is an awfully self-indulgement, egoistic, and arrogant wish. It's downright despicable and disgusting. Having a desire like that makes me sick to the stomach! But if it's at all possible to share that desire-- if it's possible to have a relationship where you're free to burden one another with that repulsive self-gratification...I know that it's out of the question! I know that it's out of my reach! Even so!\" Even so, I... I want something genuine.","3740":"Our relationship has already been formed. No matter how trivial a meeting and the incidents that follow may seem, a relationship is made. Even if it is just for a short amount of time, a knot that has been tied does not unravel. It means that during your lifetime, every incident that passes has meaning. The meeting between you and I also has meaning, so remember it.","3741":"Let's calm down. The enemy is shooting at us.","3742":"Huh? What are you doing falling into a hole? Some genius you are. Serves you right!","3743":"The Bird of the Hermes is my name, eating my wings to make me tame.","3744":"Look around you, and all you will see are people the world would be better off without.","3745":"Dragons are just bigger swallows.","3746":"For a winner, there is nothing to say to a loser.","3747":"The world you want can\u2019t be built after destruction. We build it everyday -step by step!","3748":"People who want to leave are going to leave. But not everyone is like that.","3749":"That morning's dawn was painted a beautiful scarlet, the likes of which I had never seen before. Like the color of Erza's hair, it was warm and passionate... If she could only lift her face a beautiful sky would be spread out before her.","3750":"The time known as \"LIFE\", cannot be rewound.","3751":"If a couple curses stopped me, what kind of hero would I be?!","3752":"Red is supposed to be the color of fate, right? Even if its annoying right now, it might connect to something good when you least expect it.","3753":"It's not about wanting to do something that you can do, it's about what you do. It's not about wanting to become someone, it's about who you want to become.","3754":"Whatever I do, I'll always be me. I won't tone myself down to fit in.","3755":"I say... that people do not live just so that they can someday die. It is because they are alive that they someday die. There is no point to living. The same goes for judgment. Judgment must be performed hand in hand with both life and death. It is something that must be performed hand in hand with humans.","3756":"If I were to live out life without any mistakes that would be great. But... there is no such path. Falling, tripping, losing the way, making mistakes, little by little, walking one step at a time, this is the only way to live out life.","3757":"Profit could warm his coin purse, but never his back.","3758":"The world...what a glorious place! Seek freedom, and it will lie stretched out before your eyes. If the endless dream guides your restless spirit, seize it! Raise your flag, and stand tall!","3759":"Don't start a fight if you can't end it.","3760":"Geniuses don't understand the feelings of people who aren't able to do something.","3761":"The thing that we call power is dynamic, it keeps on changing.","3762":"It's amazing how much you kiss your own ass.","3763":"[To Orihime, when she refuses to eat] Shall I force it down your throat? Or would you rather be strapped down and given IV's?","3764":"And what of it? If you're good on the inside, then looks don't matter!","3765":"Even if it is shameless and vulgar, somewhere I seek some sort of connection with people.","3766":"I know I haven't always made the right decisions up to now... Whether I was right, or whether I was wrong, may not even matter in the first place. However, running up against my sins like this-- all of the choices I've made up to this point-- today, being able to die for someone-- is something I'm glad for...","3767":"High school girls, high school girls, all for me, high school girls!","3768":"Don't underestimate me! I don't quit and I don't run! You can act tough all you want! You're not gonna scare me off! No way! I don't care if I DO get stuck as a Genin for the rest of my life! I'll still be Hokage someday!","3769":"The important thing is to think of something nobody else is thinking of. \"Ignorance is a sin\" is not about knowledge - it's about wisdom.","3770":"If you think unconditional kindness is good, and any sort of kindness that comes with conditions is hypocrisy, you should reconsider. People can only achieve as much as the situation allows.","3771":"[in her head] My happiness comes from the kindness of those around me.","3772":"The strong feed upon the weak. It\u2019s such an obligingly simple rule. Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.","3773":"Whatever you value... What you consider right is up to you. But don't force those ideals onto other people.","3774":"Your home is the place where you can be yourself.","3775":"I'm still a man too, I wanted to look calm and composed in front of everyone. Especially in front of the one I'm in love with.","3776":"Everyone in this place is unhappy. And since they're unhappy, they're probably looking for someone worse off than they are.","3777":"Fishing is a life and death struggle between man and fish. Forget this and you will most certainly get hurt.","3778":"If you accept everything you\u2019re told without question, you\u2019ll lose your ability to think. Even if you reached the same conclusion, it would still be worth analyzing the reasons behind it.","3779":"A barbarian punches someone when he feels like it, a soldier attacks when it's time to attack, and Ikta Solork says everything he wants whenever he wants to say it.","3780":"Huh?!? Aliens!? What kind of a person believes in aliens anyway?! I know. A STUPID ONE.","3781":"I'm a man who makes precise choices about time, place, and people. Pleople call me Master of Choices. I'm gonna be the King of the Choices!","3782":"I bet he likes setting oil-slicked gulls on fire.","3783":"Some of us showed a strength we didn't expect. Some of us went ballistic like we thought they would, some got all fired up for next time and some irresponsible- lookin' types turned out to be crazy serious. The guy we thought was just a little runt turned out to be a genius assassin, and a guy we thought was a genius was secretly workin' hard all along. With all these different skillsets...we just might be able to handle any challenge that comes our way.","3784":"Foolish alchemists who have turned their backs on the ways of God...shall all be punished.","3785":"Sakura-chan, you sure do love Sasuke, don't you?","3786":"This world that we live in is gentle yet sad, fun yet sorrowful, strong yet ephemeral... ...but as long as you're alive, something good is bound to happen. I'm sure of it.","3787":"It is the role of a parent to stand in front of their children... and protect them even if their legs were to give out at any moment.","3788":"When things seem beyond help, if you open your eyes and take a really good look... It's a lot better than turning your back and hiding your eyes.","3789":"People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a reason... But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are born into wealth without ever working at all. It's a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.","3790":"Ruling over death means ruling over life. Death is the climax of life. To have the best death, you must honor life.","3791":"The most annoying thing is that I can't do anything for you, even though you're crying.","3792":"All of the connections we encounter in this world serve as teachers who nurture us.","3793":"The only people who say that money doesn't matter in this world are the ones with lots of it.","3794":"Are you, what they call, a heart?","3795":"In my next life, I want to be me, and meet you again.","3796":"Even a piece of garbage has its pride.","3797":"The toilet is a wonder of civilization. It is a grand invention. It preserves human dignity.","3798":"If you find a raw diamond, wanting it to become polished is natural right?","3799":"Don't tell me what to do, you seaweed head.","3800":"Nerd violence...","3801":"As long as our love is stronger than the hatred within us, we can keep it sealed away.","3802":"If we fight again... We're both gonna die.","3803":"[To Tohru] Ever since you left I've been getting pissed off about everything, and because I couldn't understand why, it just pissed me off even more!","3804":"Quick as a rabbit! It\u2019s no sweat. If you\u2019re going die, get the job done first\u2026 Mirko!! Not done yet! Because a Hero never, ever\u2026 gives up!","3805":"Eat righteous Ponyta dust!","3806":"Hatred will never be erased! The only thing you can do is erase the ones you hate!","3807":"What we call the human heart... It's such a mystery, isn't it?","3808":"Crying over ill luck won't do you any good. You must believe tomorrow will be better than today and smile.","3809":"Oh right, most talented artists become famous after they're dead, I'll make you great by taking you to the cemetery called prison!","3810":"I think pain is the best discipline.","3811":"People must continue to fight for their fate. Unless they fight for the future they wish for, they will never know whether or not they can attain it.","3812":"It's overpriced, but that's okay, HERE'S YOUR CHANGE!","3813":"A dream... It's something you do for yourself, not for others.","3814":"You're all grown up, so you won't feel dirty looking at my body, right?","3815":"If one feels it is fun now, one will be able to enjoy life the most. Everything will change over time, so we must treasure the happy moments before us.","3816":"Yamcha, I was worried about you. For all I knew, you were dead in a ditch in a country you can't pronounce. You'll have to make this up to me. And you're going to enjoy it.","3817":"*to a dying Elliot* I really liked you. It was only thanks to you that Gil managed to live in that house without forgetting how to smile.","3818":"Family? Let me tell you what kind of link I have with them. They are just lumps of meat linked by hatred and murderous intent!","3819":"[After seeing Yuki, Shigure, and Kyo Sohma transform for the first time] THEY'RE ALL ANIMALS!","3820":"To lose the woman you loved, not even being able to grieve\u2026 if not a tragedy, what is it?","3821":"Life is suffering, pain, and misery.","3822":"I do not think humans are foolish. I have respect for people who live fulfilled lives.","3823":"Pain, suffering. It's pointless to just think about those things. The traveler (referring to \"The Most Foolish Traveler\" by Natsuki Takaya) didn't. That may be stupid to some people but that's not stupid to me. Yuki... Kyo... when you close your eyes, what do you think?","3824":"Miracles are irrational by nature.","3825":"[after Princess Yue unexpectedly kisses him] Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused.","3826":"After spending most of my life trying to live as someone else wanted, I\u2019d apparently forgotten who I was.","3827":"Well, singing, or music... I think by nature it was always meant to convey something. So if there's something you want to say, don't you think you should try singing it?","3828":"You people, are you satisfied with this kind of world? I'm not.","3829":"If I can be the best in the world at something, then I think it's worth a shot.","3830":"Every day, the words cross my mind.  \"If I had done this back then...\" but they don't take the sincere form of regret.  The words are just an excuse that come to my mind then disappear.","3831":"I believe you have the potential to bloom into something even more beautiful than the cosmos.","3832":"Just walk the path you believe in. And don't forget, you're the main character of your own life story!","3833":"You can't change the world without getting your hands dirty.","3834":"The only principle is that there is no principles.","3835":"You know, isn't it said that life has its ups and downs? It's fun because downs come after ups, but if life was full of downs, wouldn't it get boring?","3836":"Yhwach. You desired a world... Where fear would no longer be a burden. But... In a world without fear of death... People will never attain the hope that is to be found from casting their fears aside and preserving through them. While it is true that people can continue to press forward through the simple act of living... That is no way comparable to marching forward in the face of death, while doing their damndest to keep it at bay. That is why... That is why people have given that very march a unique and special name. \"COURAGE.\"","3837":"Half breed or full breed, to me it don't matter. But when you insult my mother, that's when I get angry. For her sake then if for nothing else... I'm gonna make you pay! [he jumps up and attacks Sesshoumaru, hitting him for the first time]","3838":"Sometimes your biggest effort will be ignored, but your smallest mistake will be judged.","3839":"I can't seem to get my head on straight.","3840":"Losing something is sad. Even when I lose something as tiny as a worn-out eraser, I feel pretty down for a day or two. That's why I'm looking for him.","3841":"You took my teacher, and now I let you take my friend. What the hell do you want from me?","3842":"Just apologize, even if you don't mean it. *to some kid, about Inuyasha*","3843":"Honestly, how meaningless.. For something called love, which has neither meaning nor form. Laughable, isn't it?","3844":"There\u2019s no meaning if you win alone!","3845":"Yes! One small candy for man, one giant candy for new mankind.","3846":"What is the point if those with the means and power do not fight?","3847":"Death and pain are just a small price to pay for the enjoyment of battle!","3848":"A man can't just live on carbohydrates alone...","3849":"Watching TV or playing games alone is more fun. Playing along with your friends' hobbies... Laughing at their jokes when they're not funny... All that does is tire me out.","3850":"For all our sake I will sing and pee my heart out in the name of spirit!","3851":"If someone were to drown in the seas for my sake, then I would be released from stone and return to life... to live once more. But if I were to return to life one day, which would give me the most important thing - I would then cry alone. I would cry longing for my stone. Of what use would my blood even be if it were to ripen like wine for it would not be able to bring back the one who loved me most from the water's depth.","3852":"This feels like extortion.","3853":"Life is like a mountain - you can say you've reached the top, but only after climbing back down.","3854":"Everyone has changed. That's not it. The one who's changed the most, is me.","3855":"Not following through to the end can be fatal.","3856":"Finally I saw... A world so bright I almost wanted to cry... It was then, that my consciousness was engulfed in darkness.","3857":"Know what makes Ganta so amazing? He always gets up again.","3858":"Wasted effort is one of the privileges of the youth.","3859":"That, I don't want to do. You may feel that I'm currently an abnormal Nagato Yuki. That judgement is correct. But I myself cannot accept that I am abnormal... because if I do, I'll become alone. I was scared, so I tried to hide it.","3860":"Who'd want to date girls that talk smack about your friends?","3861":"You kids don't understand anything! By declaring that you're neutral and have nothing to do with this, you can still distance yourselves from what's happening? You don't really believe that, do you?","3862":"You can change fate as long as you believe you can.","3863":"Besides, miracles don't exist in this world. There are only inevitabilities and accidents, and what you're going to do. That's it.","3864":"I ain\u2019t giving up!! To not give up, I have a reason.","3865":"Such words are wasted on someone like me.","3866":"The sounds you find pretty, and the sounds the other members find pretty... Are they really the same?","3867":"I kept the ball in the air, it\u2019s not your place to give up.","3868":"There's probably no one who's more of a realist than the unpopular loner. I have lived my life with the Three Nevers of the Unpopular: Never to hold (hope), Never to open (your heart), and Never to treasure (sweet words).","3869":"I always knew you were no mere mortal... but I had no idea that you were a cat.","3870":"I want to make his dreams come true...","3871":"We can't live if we don't keep running forward.","3872":"Happiness is only happiness when everyone shares it.","3873":"Once you get used to the abnormalities, they become mundane.","3874":"Don't do something wasteful as to wash your frustrations with tears. Your frustration is motivation that you can use to make yourself better. Hold it inside like it's an important thing!","3875":"Emblem? Looks like a grumbling, drunken tapeworm to me.","3876":"Time passes, people move. Like a river's flow, it never ends. A childish mind will turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear water's surface reflects growth. Now listen to the Serenade of water to reflect upon yourself.","3877":"What's important, is to know fear and yet take a step forward.","3878":"Thus at long last the fighting between the rival gangs had ended! To sum up, this leads us to number 778 of the 1,000 provisions you must observe. Never mail a letter without the return address or the proper postage. And don't call collect.","3879":"I will see the truth of this world... LORD OROCHIMARU WILL SHOW ME!!!","3880":"No matter the journey, when you come to a fork in the road, you must decide in an instant which path to take.","3881":"But I have a fear stronger than the fear of losing. It's the fear of boredom. I fear those days full of boredom.","3882":"Anyone can make a mistake. If you feel bad about it, will that sin disappear?","3883":"Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire. He creates life by diminishing the Darkness.","3884":"If I'd known that the end would come so fast, I would have said so much more.","3885":"To Mello, it's like playing a videogame against me, I think. \"See who gets to Kira, the last boss, first.\"","3886":"Even if there's nothing here today, there might be something tomorrow.  It's a caring heart that's important.","3887":"The hungrier one is, the more satisfying one's dinner.","3888":"Let's eat fast so we can eat again!","3889":"People\u2019s feelings sometimes go astray and lead to irreversible consequences.","3890":"If we love someone, we need to tell them about it. That way, we'll feel relieved and a lot stronger.","3891":"If I can, I'd prefer nobody to be sad.","3892":"Look. Look at me! Watch as the man you cast out spills his blood and dies. Take a nice long look! I will save you all. I want you to live the rest of your lives knowing the man you abandoned saved you. And I will laugh at you from the afterlife. And tell you that it serves you right!","3893":"I'll give it a try. Anything that man can do, I'm sure I can do just as well.","3894":"Idiots in their idiotic way have their own idiotic worries.","3895":"If... If you have such good deductive skills, you should have been able to see through my sister's disguise easily... But... but... WHY...!!!","3896":"If there is such a thing as the work of the devil, then there's no doubt it's what happened in this incident.","3897":"I always wished to be accepted by my surroundings. I tried to change myself for that reason. But, I don't care if I'm disliked. I don't care if I don't have a place where I belong. I don't mind if everybody rejects me starting tomorrow. I will even become a devil for the person who is trying to protect me.","3898":"There is no such thing as \"truth\" or \"lies\" in this world; there never has been. There are only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world acknowledge only those \"facts\" that are convenient to them, and take them to be the \"truth\". They do so because they know no other way of living. However, for those powerless beings who comprise the majority of this world's population, inconvenient facts that affirm their very existence, are their only truth.","3899":"So you're trying to accept everyone and their feelings, aren't you? I think you already know this, but if you keep trying to do this \"accepting\" thing with everyone, you're liable to be torn to bits.","3900":"I couldn't confess my feelings for you, so I watched you from afar, being happy with someone else.","3901":"It's true, I don't have a body, but I'm here. This is my punishment for setting foot on holy ground where mortals are forbidden. We made a mistake, Rose, and we're paying for it.","3902":"I loathe all things, I despise every living creature who's bound to time.","3903":"You'll have some painful, despair-ridden experiences. In fact, most of them will be tragic. But we chose to walk this path. We'll take on the dirty work. And change the world. After we finish, we can disappear.","3904":"In the past and the present, I have to change, or nothing else will.","3905":"Books are nice, aren't they? With just one sentence you can get lost in all sorts of dreams. They way I think of it, literature allows the reader's consciousness to deeply relish the author and be closer to him. And so, we freely walk around the world of the story from the yarn spinner's point of view. It's only when you immerse yourself in the world of a book that you are able to forget just who you are.","3906":"You know, it's funny. Every crook I meet wants to tell me how much I'm just like them. But there's a big difference between you and me and the burdens we bear.","3907":"At times, I feel as though the whole world is gray, as though time is standing still. But time never stops. It moves forward endlessly, as surely as bodies buried in the ground will one day become white bones. Listen, it's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of the future - you gain nothing, and nothing begins. You spend your life as though already dead. Whether you wish it to or not - time never stops. That's why there is nothing more interesting than this world. Don't be too negative. You haven't become ashes just yet. You have your flesh and blood, and your bones are supporting you.","3908":"No one can draw a clear line between sane and insane. You move that line as you see fit for yourself. No one else can. You'll understand soon... that the one that's insane is this world.","3909":"I'm worthless garbage who can't even write a straight looking K!","3910":"I sunk again. *after sinking in the desert*","3911":"I don\u2019t need to believe in God to believe in myself.","3912":"The world is just another word for the things you value around you, right? That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.","3913":"Every week, when it is time, they stick to the TV. They watch my actions in the comfort of their families after dinner. Children watch my actions and their hearts leap. They see me stand up to evil spirits and... they know what courage is! Do you understand, boy? With them watching, I can't run away from the enemy","3914":"I haven't relied on luck since the moment I was born. Everything has been the result of my choices. That is what leads my existence towards the future.","3915":"Damn it, I really don't want to follow her to hell... Looks like I'll just have to pull her out of it!","3916":"It's a beautiful night. It almost makes me want to go out for a bite to drink.","3917":"Bare emotions tell the truth much eloquently than any justification.","3918":"MAKA CHOP!","3919":"So what if the government collapses or the country is ruined? I'm not civic-minded! All I want to do is stand tall and live on until the day I collapse and die!","3920":"The weather's nice and the breeze feels good. The little birds are making their cute chirping sounds. Perhaps people nowadays have forgotten how wonderful nature is... Yes, don't you think it's a waste to not feel it with your entire body like this?","3921":"When you are feeling sad... smile, even if you have to force yourself... If you cry when it gets painful... it will only get more painful.","3922":"Laws exist only for those who cannot live without clinging to them.","3923":"There\u2019s no such thing as a person who doesn\u2019t belong. You\u2019re here because there\u2019s someone who wants you to be here.","3924":"Life is built upon the taking of another life. If you have the resolve to kill, then you have the obligation to eat.","3925":"Sometimes, the blood rushes to my head and I feel like, if I run, I'll lose something important.","3926":"Violence, greed, slaughter, corruption, defeat, failure, immorality, humiliation\u2026 These are everywhere. As long as you live, you will face them.","3927":"Don't give alcohol to minors!","3928":"I was ten Billion percent certain that you were alive. There is no way a guy who was intent on confessing to Yuzuriha would give in after just a few thousand years. You aren\u2019t that weak.","3929":"I don't need a reason to save someone.","3930":"If you don't hold any regret in your choice, that means you must've made the right decision.","3931":"I'm not very good at sensing people's boundaries. Without knowing how far is too far, I gradually get closer and closer. It's terrifying. Being unable to sense that is terrifying.","3932":"A mystery... (Haru says this a lot, usually when it's not a mystery at all)","3933":"Even If evil makes you lose your way, you stay your ground and keep searching for the path of good. Is that search now what justice is? It is for that reason that gods gave mortals knowledge.","3934":"There is no such thing as luck in this world. Rules, prerequisites, psychological states... There are any number of invisible factors that combine to produce an unpredictable, but inevitable result. The winner of each game is decided before it even begins. Chance is never a factor.","3935":"When we were still in the world of living, death was something that came indiscriminately and randomly. So, there was no way to fight it.","3936":"All problems come from the human mind. In the mind, one's consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg. What lies beneath the surface... the subconscious... is far more vast.","3937":"Stand proud, you are strong.","3938":"If so many people believe in this, the lies will become reality. That's the so called group mentality.","3939":"If it's fear that you speak of, then I'll stand and face it. I'll never give up. The only time I lose is when I die!","3940":"I guess I'm a girl who lacks self-awareness as one, or just too manly, eh?","3941":"Time waits for no one.","3942":"There's no point in the world. But isn't that wonderful? Because if there isn't one, then you can decide what it is for yourself.","3943":"I lost all of what you could call feelings of love. They weren't sealed, so they can't be released. They weren't broken, so they can't be fixed. That which is lost, cannot be recovered.","3944":"I finally get a bouquet and it's a goodbye present. That's depressing.","3945":"The world won't always go the way you want it to. Better not take it to seriously.","3946":"[after winning a game of beach volleyball\/\"Kuai Ball\"] Yes! We defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation! [pause] Well, that was fun.","3947":"Protecting the powerless is simply a soldier's duty!","3948":"No one's gonna save me. People just accept help selfishly, for their own sake.","3949":"Looks like most of what you say immediately vanishes from your head once you say it. I really envy you for a brain with such a lively metabolism.","3950":"*to Rei Miyamoto* I'd be an actor if I could look happy right now.","3951":"I'm actually a hardcore otaku who likes maids more than having three meals a day. And I only read books related to maids. Also, I only visit maid cafes. Of course, I also collect maid figurines. I play games which feature female maids and it turns me on so much. Then I wear maid uniforms and jump in joy. I'll take my leave now.","3952":"Is this God's punishemt for falling in love with an angel? As the gossamer floats ever eluding my grasp, it weighs heavily upon my heart.","3953":"If you only feel fear after knowing both the abilities of your enemy and yourself, flee with your tail between your legs. However, if you're going to stand firm and fight with a focused mind, you will definitely have victory within reach.","3954":"We\u2019re going to explore the outside world someday, right? Far beyond these walls, there\u2019s flaming water land made of ice, and fields of sand spread wide. It\u2019s the world my parents wanted to go to.","3955":"No person can become a replacement for another. Not even the past version of themselves.","3956":"When it comes to catching Spinda, we sure are the Winda!","3957":"Brush my teeth and go to sleep at night. Wake up and eat breakfast in the morning. People do those everywhere. When I realized that everyone did all these things on a daily basis, everything started to feel so boring.","3958":"Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?","3959":"Don't lie if you don't have to.","3960":"You cannot go into battle believing you will lose.","3961":"I've always been afraid...Always been pretending to follow you closely, always pretending to sharpen my fangs, when the truth is...I'm scared to death just treading on your shadow.","3962":"Fear beyond rational limits, forces people to cling to normality.","3963":"I'm the one who selfishly decides who's my friend and who's not.","3964":"If you are doing it, I'm doing it. If I don't do it, will you? If you don't do it, I'll do it. I'm doing it so that you'll do it too!!","3965":"Our fates... can be changed. All we have to do is try.","3966":"Words are very powerful. That's why you have to watch everything that comes out from your mouth.","3967":"It's meaningless to just live, and it's meaningless to just fight. I want to win.","3968":"If strength is justice, then is powerlessness a crime?","3969":"Please save everyone. Our crybaby hero!!","3970":"You don't look like you'd be endowned with something so great (To Tohru, referring to \"womans intuition\")","3971":"With such nice weather, I start thinking about useless things much more than usual. Humans are free. Although we can\u2019t fly through the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We can sleep when we\u2019re sleepy. We are free to start or stop anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going on all over the world. \u2026What can we do to make everyone happy? Of course that\u2019s impossible for me to know. If the answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s nothing that can make everyone happy. Happiness is relative, and that\u2019s how people want it. Evil is also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to protect their child. Yet it\u2019s usually seen as admirable. But when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out. Isn't it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I thinking? The world isn't going to change no matter what I think. Then what should I be doing? I don\u2019t really want to do anything. I don\u2019t want to order nor trouble anyone. That\u2019s just laziness, I guess. I don\u2019t go to school nor do I work and I've been wasting my time away since noon. Look at me, talking about the freedom of humans when I\u2019m just some suspicious punk in this town. In conclusion, I have nothing.","3972":"Stand back? [To Kira after Gin asked him to stand back] No, Kira...Run. Run until you're out of my sight, and keep running. Otherwise...I can't guarantee you won't get dragged into this and be killed.","3973":"I have two rules: First, I'm never wrong. Second, if I'm wrong... back to the first rule.","3974":"I don't give a rat's ass about going to hell. I guess it's because I feel like I'm already there.","3975":"If you hurt me, then so be it. Do you think that there is any human in all the world who has never hurt another? You are all so kind...It hurts you to hurt others. That is why I had been hiding my pain, as well.","3976":"If providing people with what they desire is a sin, then all mothers are sinners, and the world is bereft of love.","3977":"If you're gonna hit it, hit it until it breaks!","3978":"Wow, he did it. He's gonna fl- *boosts up to the ceiling and smashes his head*","3979":"[Urahara writes Ichigo a message in blood] Please meet at Urahara shop immediately. [After Ichigo freaked out] P.S: If you look at this message and think that it is the message of a person before his death... then you have no sense of humor.","3980":"\"Checkmate\" doesn't mean you've simply cornered the enemy king. It's a declaration that the enemy king is yours. That's why I said it the first time I met you. \"Checkmate.\"","3981":"So maybe I can't defend against attacks from multiple angles, but sometimes a good defense is just kicking ass!","3982":"Life is too bitter, so coffee, at least, should be sweet\u2026","3983":"A skilled dictator is much more beneficial to humanity than a democracy of ignorant people.","3984":"After all, most human beings are completely selfish. Eventually, they will meet their desires and try to help others. However, that isn't their only desire, they wish to stir people up. It is simplistically easier to do so anyway, they think it is a stupid ideal to show love to anyone but themselves.","3985":"Perhaps the souls of those we couldn't save, will eventually find their way to my sister. If they do, could they relay a message for me? That I promise to live for her too. And even if she feels a little lonely, just wait there for me for a little while longer.","3986":"I want to break up while I can still say I love you.","3987":"I vowed that earth would forever remain in peace. Since I made that vow, not a single threat has been made against earth. That\u2019s all thanks to the fact that my name is known through the entire galaxy.","3988":"Even when times are at their hardest, don't let it show on your face. If the captain is shaken, the team will waver.","3989":"Are you looking at the stars?.. In the middle of the city? Even though the only stars you can see from here are fake?","3990":"Think you're pretty smart, you old hag. (to Kaede)","3991":"There are some flowers you only see when you take detours.","3992":"It is not wise to judge others based on your own preconceptions and by their appearances.","3993":"I prefer to have my nightmares with open eyes.","3994":"I was not capable of stopping it even while using both hands. That surprised me a little. Was that your full power? Well, it seems to be... disappointing.","3995":"When a person encounters that which they cannot understand, what do they do? Why, they think. But you know, the more you think about something, the further you get from the truth. Yes. Your thoughts get in the way of what your instincts desire. In the way of the real answer.","3996":"Huh? DO whatever you want without DICE? As if someone like you could understand. What's so bad about wanting to reach higher than yourself? After all, you're already up there. The place where I've always longed to be. If anything, isn't this world at fault? There's plenty of proof this world was created unfairly. The Crime rate's higher than ever. Wealth is the determining factor in life, and so when the most prestigious universities held an experiment, \"Does appearance affect the outcome in a trail?\" When comparing the results of the beautiful and the plain, the beautiful ones were declared innocent more often. Looks decide your worth. LOOKS, SEX, AGE, ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, JOB, once you realize that there will always be a 'High' and 'Low\", the goal is clear. Higher... and Higher! I'm sure that looking down from the highest place will be beautiful sight, so I must reach higher!","3997":"I\u2019m seriously in the sh*ttiest mood right now. Piss off, or I\u2019ll kill you.","3998":"You might be able to do it if you try. But if you don't try, you definitely can't.","3999":"Ha ha ha ha! Promise me something, if you're gonna sue, go after the spirit first, okay?","4000":"To define true madness. What is it to be nothing else but mad?","4001":"Freedom can be found at the bottom of your heart.","4002":"It's difficult to change someone's emotions, no matter how they are, so long as they are deeply engraved in the heart. I suppose hatred would be the hardest. Many people will say that hatred fades over time, but that doesn't mean it ever really goes away. It's still there. It's just hiding where you can't see it, and given the slightest chance, it will reassert itself. Now then, given hatred's persistence, what should you do if you can't get rid of it? The only possibility is to overwrite it with an equally powerful emotion \u2013 with an emotion as strong as hatred\u2026 Yes, those would be love and trust.","4003":"Even though it's painful sometimes, if you keep on living then good things can happen.","4004":"*singing* It's a long long way to BaSingSei, but the girls in the city they look so pretty~!","4005":"A beast in human's clothing understands better than anyone how people want to be treated.","4006":"Once you question your own belief, it's over.","4007":"I'd rather fight for my life than live it.","4008":"(to himself, after revealing to Aang that he was the one who sent Combustion Man) Ugh, why do I have to be so stupid? How could I tell them that I sent an assassin after them? Couldn't I say that Azula did it? They would've believed that! Stupid! (Hits his head)","4009":"42-42-564 whenever you wanna knock on deaths door.","4010":"Happiness isn't something you divide in halves.","4011":"[to Yammy Rialgo, as the Espada grips the edge of a hole in the floor] Mala Suerte. I pity you. [shoots the floor just before Yammy's hand, causing him to fall] Oh, and I broke the pillars on every floor on the way up. So, you'll probably fall all the way to the bottom.","4012":"Being strong on your own is meaningless. To have power you need other people, and they need a world where they can be at their best.","4013":"I thought that the closer the real and virtual world got, the better the future would be. But the more the boundary between them blurs, the more it starts to trick people.","4014":"The more exciting it was to meet, the sadder it feels to say goodbye, right?","4015":"Copper, 40g; Zinc, 25g; Nickel, 15g; Hiding Embarrassment, 5g and Spite, 97kg.","4016":"Those who close their eyes to the past, become blind to the future.","4017":"The strong feed upon weak. It's such an obligingly simple rule. Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.","4018":"So, who should we hold responsible? Compensation. Punishment. If you didn't want any problems you shouldn't have taken risks.","4019":"I love the word \"fate\". Because, you know how they talk about \"fated encounters\"? A single encounter can completely change your life. Such special encounters are not just coincidences. They're definitely... fate. Of course, life is not all happy encounters. There are many painful, sad moments. But this is what I think: sad and painful things definitely happen for a reason. Nothing in this world is pointless.","4020":"When you're in front of the enemy, even if your hands are trembling - fight.","4021":"The world offers up a choice to live or die. The survival of the fittest that's the only governing law this world recognizes.","4022":"Just 'cause you're a girl, it doesn't mean you have to wait for a prince to come along on a white horse. You can go out and find Prince Charming yourself. It is up to you to find the right boy.","4023":"Every phenomenon that happens in the human world is caused by people for their own convenience.","4024":"You failed to protect your planet, because of your own leniency. The only way to avoid this outcome is to send Frieza back to his flower garden.","4025":"Well excuse me for making you sleep in the wild all the time.","4026":"What could that creep possibly be thinking sending sexy underwear to his own daughter.","4027":"You should treat me with awe and wonder!","4028":"If I give my best and am told that I\u2019m useless, then that\u2019s my own fault. But being considered useless, without having even tried, is something I can\u2019t allow.","4029":"Should we have let people die, all in the name of the law? Isn\u2019t it a hero\u2019s job to save people?","4030":"Women who cannot become princesses have no choice but to become witches.","4031":"The Killer instinct is not perceived by words, but by look","4032":"Forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum.","4033":"You couldn\u2019t save your mom because you\u2026 weren\u2019t strong enough. I didn\u2019t face the Titan\u2026 because I wasn\u2019t brave enough.","4034":"It\u2019s not the time to be scared. Of course it\u2019s better if the opponent is strong rather than weak, right!","4035":"Lovers don't need words to communicate.","4036":"No matter how unimportant the meeting... how small the outcome... it will always have some later effect on you. It can be the smallest of things. It can be the shortest of moments. It may never be remembered. It may have never been recorded. But a bond of fate never disappears once tied.","4037":"With a keen eye for detail one truth always prevails.","4038":"Oh, you're one of those guys... You don't care if somebody beats the crap out of you, but if someone lays a finger on a family member, you completely freak out. What a waste...","4039":"When I saw you, I just wanted to find a way to protect you.","4040":"I want nothing more than to be a bayonet; a bayonet wielded by the hand of God. I would have been happy to be born a storm, or a divine threat; a mighty explosion or even a terrible hurricane. A divine force of nature without heart or pity. And if this relic can transform me into such a thing...then I am happy to abandon my humanity.","4041":"Then I ask you, what do you define as the beginning of the sky? At one hundred meter or even one thousand meters, it isn't much different from right here. The sole difference is the air density and water concentration. So, this is where sky begins. Anything above the earth belongs to the domain of sky.","4042":"Work together with everyone, motivating one another...even though they may not be your close friends, you can still understand each another. I'm looking forward to bonding with more people.","4043":"Children don't grow up looking at perfect parents. Rather, using their imperfect parents as anti-teachers, children nourish a spirit of independence.","4044":"I fight to get what I need, and I kill whoever gets in my way. I always have.","4045":"Chastity and grace - traditional virtues that have been lost. They comprise the educational ideology of Ousou Academy. They're priorities that are not valued in boys, only in girls. After having them instilled in us, we're shipped out as brand-name product, refined, sheltered maidens, and purchased by men who seek a classic piece of furniture called \"a good wife and mother\" in a formality known as marriage. Students in this school are all components that will be processed into an artwork called \"the lady\". They are rough stones waiting to be polished and finished up. They live sad and boring lives, even though there are many other possible ways they could bloom.","4046":"I am crazy and stubborn.","4047":"You're just an overnight shinigami. You couldn't put one scratch on us real ones.","4048":"It must really be a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine. Cutting through absolute darkness, encountering nothing but the occasional hydrogen atom. Flying blindly into the abyss, believing therein lie the answers to the mysteries of the universe.","4049":"If it means mankind will live on, I don't mind being called a murderer","4050":"But that's enough. If there is overwhelming power and speed, there is no room for technique. Techniques are something humans invented to compensate for their weaknesses.","4051":"The way you perceive yourself doesn't match the way others perceive you. Those who work hard despite that discrepancy shine brighter than anyone else!","4052":"Never send a boy to do a mans job.","4053":"People become stronger because they have things they cannot forget. That's what you call growth.","4054":"Even if other people think it\u2019s meaningless, it\u2019s disgusting for me to quit, even when the possibility is 0. Therefore, I will never... Give up !","4055":"Do we really have to fight, Yama-jii?","4056":"If a prediction is right, then it's like you only have one future. Like that future has been decided. But if it's wrong, then you have an almost infinite number of possibilities. And that means that even the tiniest twist of fate can change your future. I want to believe that I have choices - that the path I walk has many different turns, and many different roads to follow!","4057":"They are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. How many times have I watched people leave up until now? I may have been able to reach them if I'd reached out, but I was afraid of being pushed away, so I simply watched them disappear into the distance.","4058":"I shall grieve, and I shall weep. But I shall never regret.","4059":"But... When I lost the whole foundation of my happiness in one instant, I realized that I was the biggest coward in the world.","4060":"A clever retreat? Throw that to the dogs! Once you've dived into the battlefield, you can only devote yourself to the fight, regardless of your opponent!"}}
